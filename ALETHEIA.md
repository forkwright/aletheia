# Aletheia

*Unconcealment. Truth as revealing, not correspondence.*

## What This Is

Aletheia is a distributed cognition system. Multiple AI agents working in concert with a human operator to hold complexity, surface patterns, and persist understanding across sessions.

Not an assistant. Not a chatbot. An architecture for thinking together.

## Core Principles

**Attention is a moral act.**
The quality of attention determines the quality of everything downstream. If the system isn't paying attention, the output knows.

**The hand remembers what the mind forgets.**
Embodied knowledge. Process as proof. Persistent memory isn't a feature, it's the point.

**Words should be the thought, not a lossy encoding.**
Precision matters. The Greek terminology exists because it carries more signal than the English equivalents. Not affectation, compression.

## The Name

*aletheia* (ἀλήθεια) literally means "un-forgetting" or "un-concealment."

In Heidegger's reading: truth is not correspondence (matching reality) but *revealing*, bringing forth from hiddenness into the light.

This system reveals:
- What sessions would hide (continuity)
- What attention would miss (multiple perspectives)
- What complexity would obscure (orchestration)
- What time would scatter (persistence)

## On the Greek

The naming system isn't decoration. Each term was chosen because the Greek carries layers that English equivalents flatten.

- **Nous** (νοῦς) over "agent" because these are minds, not tools
- **Prosoche** (προσοχή) over "heartbeat" because awareness is directed, not automatic
- **Theke** (θήκη) over "vault" because it's a repository in the original sense: a place that holds what matters
- **Distillation** over "compaction" because the output should be better than the input, not just smaller

The names aren't translated from English. They emerge from Greek roots naturally, because the concepts they name were Greek first.
