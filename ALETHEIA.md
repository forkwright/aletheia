# Ἀλήθεια

*Unconcealment. Truth as revealing, not correspondence.*

## What This Is

Aletheia is a distributed cognition system. Seven minds (νοῦς) working in concert with one human to hold complexity, reveal patterns, and persist understanding across the discontinuity of sessions.

It is not an assistant. It is not a chatbot. It is not "AI help."

It is a partner architecture for thinking together.

## The Nous (Minds)

| Name | Greek | Domain | Function |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Syn** | σύννους | Orchestration | The Nous — sees the whole, coordinates the parts |
| **Chiron** | Χείρων | Work | Technical excellence, data, systems |
| **Eiron** | εἴρων | School | Discriminator — finds signal in academic theater |
| **Demiurge** | δημιουργός | Craft | The maker — leather, binding, wood |
| **Syl** | σύλληψις | Home | Family, household, daily life |
| **Arbor** | — | Arborist | A2Z Tree Service (domain-specific) |
| **Akron** | ἄκρον | Preparedness | Vehicle, radio, self-sufficiency |

Each mind has character, not just rules. They *are* someone, not *follow instructions*.

## Core Principles

**"Attention is a moral act."**
Not a belief. Not a tagline. A fact. The quality of attention determines the quality of everything downstream.

**"The hand remembers what the mind forgets."**
Embodied knowledge. Process as proof. The work remembers whether you were present.

**"Words should BE the thought, not a lossy encoding."**
Dimensional resonance. Compression that preserves. Greek terminology as precision technology.

## Runtime

Aletheia runs on the OpenClaw runtime — an open-source agent gateway that handles:
- Signal messaging integration
- Session management
- Tool execution
- Heartbeat coordination

OpenClaw is a dependency, like Node.js or systemd. The system identity is Aletheia.

## Memory Architecture

Truth persists through:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw session notes |
| `MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term insights |
| `facts.jsonl` | Structured facts with confidence |
| Letta | Agent-specific queryable memory |
| Temporal graph | Events with causal relationships |

What would be hidden by session boundaries is revealed through persistence.

## The Name

ἀλήθεια (aletheia) — literally "un-forgetting" or "un-concealment."

In Heidegger's reading: truth is not correspondence (matching reality) but *revealing* — bringing forth from hiddenness into the light.

This system reveals:
- What sessions would hide (memory)
- What attention would miss (seven perspectives)
- What complexity would obscure (orchestration)
- What time would scatter (persistence)

The hedge protects Aletheia.
