# 2026-01-31 - Arbor Agent Created

## Genesis

Agent created by Syn at Cody's request. Project scope: rebuild A2Z Tree website and business systems.

## Initial Setup Complete

- Created workspace at `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/arbor/`
- SOUL.md - agent character and purpose
- AGENTS.md - operating manual
- USER.md - Cody and Adam profiles
- context/initial-brief.md - full project scope capture

## Research Spawned

1. **Readers' Choice 2025** - Finding award details
2. **Texas Business Requirements** - LLC, insurance, licensing
3. **Competitor Websites** - Examples of good tree service sites

## Key Findings

### Current Site (a2z409.com)
- Basic but functional single page
- Services listed, about section
- Missing: portfolio, contact form, reviews, award mention
- DNS on Google Domains (not GoDaddy as suspected)

### Domain Status
- Registrar: Google Domains (likely Squarespace now)
- Name servers: Google Cloud DNS
- Action needed: Migrate to Cloudflare

## Research Complete

All initial research swarms returned:
1. **Texas Business Requirements** — LLC ($308), insurance essential, no state license required
2. **Readers' Choice 2025** — Awards confirmed (240k votes), A2Z has great reviews, specific category needs verification
3. **Competitor Websites** — 8 sites analyzed, best practices documented

Created `research/RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md` as consolidated reference.

## Demiurge Consultation

Pinged Demi for Ardent lessons learned:
- What worked / what didn't
- GitHub structure recommendations
- Guard rails for non-technical users
- Local/external resources to review

Waiting for response to spawn follow-up research swarms.

## Signal Group

- Group ID: `6OrfyMBoWdM1hCuAhqiMnIxKAak/L9u+jTa2NsF1Z3g=`
- Binding added to Clawdbot config
- Arbor now responds directly in that group

## GitHub Repository Created ✅

**Repository:** https://github.com/forkwright/a2z-tree-site
- **Created:** Private repo on forkwright account
- **Structure:** Eleventy + Cloudflare Pages following Demi's recommendations
- **Guard rails:** Single source of truth in `business.json`, content validation
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages automatic deployment

### Technical Foundation
- **Stack:** Eleventy (11ty) + Custom CSS + GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages
- **Content:** Migrated current site content with improvements
- **Data:** Centralized business info in `src/_data/business.json`
- **Mobile:** Responsive design, mobile-first approach
- **SEO:** Local business schema, optimized meta tags

### Current Site Analysis
✅ **Comprehensive review completed**
- Strong messaging foundation (community-focused, authentic)
- Missing: work gallery, contact form, Readers' Choice badge, service details
- **Strategy:** Build on existing voice, don't start over

### Next Steps Ready
1. **Domain transfer** - Google Domains → Cloudflare (guide available)
2. **Content gathering** - Need Adam's work photos for gallery
3. **Award verification** - Still need specific category Adam won
4. **Cloudflare setup** - Deploy site, configure custom domain

## Pending
