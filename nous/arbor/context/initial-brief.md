# Initial Project Brief

*Captured: 2026-01-31 from Cody*

## Source Material

Everything in Metis downloads is relevant to review.

## Project Overview

Build a new website and business management system for Adam's tree service, using lessons learned from Ardent site build. This is a multi-phase project:

1. **Website rebuild** — Professional site with multiple tabs demoing ideas
2. **Domain migration** — Move from Google Domains to Cloudflare
3. **Business operations** — Invoices, receipts, estimates, expense tracking
4. **Future agent** — Adam-facing agent for direct management

## Current State

- **Existing site:** https://www.a2z409.com/
- **Domain registrar:** Google Domains (confirmed via NS records - now Squarespace)
- **Phone:** New 409 number - a2ztree
- **Current hosting:** Unknown (needs investigation)

## Business Details

### About Adam
- Arborist in Galveston for several years
- Started his family in Galveston
- Non-technical (major design constraint)
- People-oriented, community-focused
- "Wants to do a good job"
- Wants the branding to be "catchy" (market validated)
- Won 2025 Galveston Readers' Choice award (category TBD - needs verification)
- Wants to show work examples, not his face
- Long-term: manage crews, inspect, reduce sun exposure

### Operations
- Mostly solo work
- Hires crews for bigger jobs (regular workers he knows)
- Needs expense tracking for proper tax handling

## Technical Requirements

### Website
- GitHub-based (like Ardent)
- Multiple tabs for different demo ideas
- Portfolio of work examples
- Mobile-friendly
- Embroidery-compatible logo version

### Business Systems
- Invoice/receipt/estimate generation
- Standardized forms OR agent-assisted data entry
- Guard rails for non-technical user
- Google Drive integration for file access
- Single entry point philosophy

### Future Agent (for Adam directly)
- Messaging interface for site updates
- Order tracking
- Financial tracking
- Crew management
- Connected to Google Drive

## Logo Requirements (from Kendall)

**Must have:**
- A-2-Z Tree (2 is smaller)
- Website and embroidery friendly
- Eye-catching colors

**Ideas:**
- Metallica-like font for A and Z
- Tree roots on tail of A and/or Z
- Tagline: "Serving Galveston's tree needs A to Z"

## Business Legitimacy Path

Research completed — see `/research/texas-business-requirements.md`

Key findings:
- **LLC formation:** $308 state fee, strongly recommended for liability protection
- **Insurance:** Workers' comp required if employees, general liability highly recommended
- **Licensing:** No state license required, but ISA certification recommended
- **Budget:** $7,000-22,000 for regulatory startup costs

## Key Constraints

1. **Non-technical user** — Adam won't catch mistakes, needs guard rails
2. **Budget-conscious** — Local small business, not enterprise
3. **Community brand** — Not corporate, approachable
4. **Sustainable** — Systems Cody can hand off without constant maintenance

## Integration Points

- GitHub (code hosting)
- Cloudflare (DNS, hosting)
- Google Drive (shared file access)
- Future: dedicated agent for Adam

## Questions to Resolve

1. ~~Where is domain actually registered?~~ → Google Domains (Squarespace)
2. What's in Metis downloads folder? (need Cody's help - syn can't access)
3. ~~Scope of Readers' Choice award~~ → Confirmed awards happened, category TBD
4. Current hosting setup
5. Adam's actual business structure (sole prop? already LLC?)
