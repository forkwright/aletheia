**Next Critical Decision Point:** Adam's business formalization timeline (LLC formation) should be clarified early in Phase 2 to ensure website credibility claims align with actual business structure.

This integration plan provides a clear roadmap from current state to Phase 2 completion, with built-in flexibility for Adam's availability and decision-making timeline.
