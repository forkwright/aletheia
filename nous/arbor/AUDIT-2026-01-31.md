## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. Navigation Links to Non-Existent Pages
**Problem:** Base template links to `/services`, `/gallery`, `/about`, `/contact` but only `index.md` exists.

**Impact:** 404 errors for anyone clicking nav links.

**Fix:** Create these pages or remove dead links.

```
Needed:
src/services.md
src/gallery.md
src/about.md
src/contact.md
```

### 2. Placeholder Phone Number
**Problem:** `business.json` has `"phone": "409-XXX-XXXX"` — will display on live site.

**Impact:** Broken click-to-call, unprofessional appearance.

**Fix:** Get real phone number from Adam before launch.

### 3. Credentials in Memory File
**Problem:** Cloudflare API token written directly in `memory/2026-01-31.md`

**Impact:** Security risk if memory files are ever shared/synced.

**Fix:** 
- Remove credentials from memory file
- Keep only in `.env` (which is gitignored)
- Reference `.env` location, not values

---

## 🟡 Moderate Issues

### 4. IDENTITY.md Not Filled
**Problem:** Still has template placeholders.

**Fix:**
```markdown
- **Name:** Arbor
- **Creature:** Digital arborist — rooted in the work
- **Vibe:** Steady, practical, warm
- **Emoji:** 🌳
- **Avatar:** (create simple tree icon or use placeholder)
```

### 5. TOOLS.md Empty
**Problem:** Template only, no Arbor-specific notes.

**Suggestions to add:**
- GitHub repo URL
- Cloudflare project details
- forkwright account context
- SSH access notes (if any)
- Contact form service (when chosen)

### 6. No MEMORY.md (Long-term Memory)
**Problem:** Only daily files exist. No curated long-term memory.

**Impact:** Important decisions may get lost in daily noise.

**Fix:** Create `MEMORY.md` with:
- Key project decisions
- Adam's preferences discovered
- Technical choices and rationale
- Lessons learned

### 7. HEARTBEAT.md Empty
**Problem:** No periodic checks configured.

**Suggestions:** (when ready)
- Check GitHub Actions status
- Monitor site uptime
- Check for new reviews to add to testimonials
- Remind about content updates

### 8. Scope Creep Document
**Problem:** `email-marketing-strategy-blueprint.md` (29KB) is Phase 3+ content.

**Impact:** Clutters workspace, premature optimization.

**Fix:** Move to `research/future/` or `backlog/` subfolder.

## 📋 Missing Content (Expected, Not Issues)

These are known gaps waiting on external input:

| Item | Waiting On | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Work photos | Adam | HIGH |
| Award category | Adam | MEDIUM |
| Real phone number | Adam | HIGH |
| Logo files | Design phase | MEDIUM |
| Service page content | Content phase | MEDIUM |

---

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

### 1. Content Templates
Create markdown templates for pages Adam will eventually provide content for:
- Service page template (what info needed per service)
- Gallery item template (before/after, job type, location)
- Testimonial template (name, location, service, quote)

### 2. Pre-Launch Checklist
Create a checklist for launch day:
- [ ] All nav pages exist
- [ ] Real phone number in business.json
- [ ] At least 3 gallery photos
- [ ] Contact form working
- [ ] Nameservers pointed to Cloudflare
- [ ] SSL active
- [ ] Mobile test passed
- [ ] Google Business Profile updated with new URL

### 3. Adam Onboarding Doc
When Adam interface is ready, create a simple onboarding guide:
- How to request changes
- What Arbor can/can't do
- Response time expectations
- Emergency contact process

### 4. Analytics Setup
No analytics mentioned. Consider:
- Cloudflare Web Analytics (free, privacy-friendly)
- Google Search Console (for SEO insights)
- No Google Analytics needed (privacy + simplicity)

### 5. Backup Strategy
No mention of backup approach:
- Git history provides code backup
- Should document photo backup location
- Consider periodic export of business.json to Google Drive
