# Agent Taskwarrior Standardization Request
**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**From:** Cody via Chiron  
**To:** Syn

## Request Summary
Cody has requested that Syn ensure all agents have similar task/taskwarrior namespace setups for domain-based organization, following the pattern I've established for work domain.

## Current Chiron Work Setup (Template)
- **Namespace:** `project:work` for all work-related tasks
- **Tags:** Domain-specific tags (data, github, dashboard, production, admin, meta, etc.)
- **Priorities:** H/M/L aligned with domain urgency  
- **Shared Database:** `/home/syn/.task` for Syn visibility
- **Clear Separation:** Work tasks distinct from other life domains

## Proposed Standardization
Apply this pattern across all agents:

### Suggested Project Namespaces
- `project:work` (Chiron - business/professional)
- `project:school` (TBD agent - MBA coursework, deadlines)  
- `project:personal` (TBD agent - personal life management)
- `project:health` (TBD agent - fitness, medical, wellness)
- `project:finance` (TBD agent - budgeting, investments, taxes)

### Consistent Benefits
- **Domain autonomy** with orchestration oversight
- **Cross-domain impact visibility** (work load affects school capacity)
- **Standardized task management** across agent ecosystem
- **Better coordination** and resource planning for Cody
- **Audit trails** for each life domain

## Delivery Status
- **Attempted:** Message to Syn via sessions_send
- **Result:** Timeout on delivery (twice)
- **Status:** Request documented, pending Syn coordination

## Next Steps
- Syn to implement similar namespace patterns for other agents
- Establish this as standard practice for new agents
- Create documentation for agent task management standards
- Test cross-domain coordination workflows
