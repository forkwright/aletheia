# Workflow Change - Direct Collaboration
**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Change:** From claude-work mediated to direct Chiron + Cody collaboration

## Previous Approach
- Chiron coordinates via claude-work on Metis
- claude-work interfaces with Summus systems
- Complex handoff process through sessions

## New Approach  
- **Direct collaboration:** Chiron + Cody
- **Cody role:** Interface with Summus systems (Redshift, databases)
- **Chiron role:** Analysis, documentation, recommendations, coordination

## Reasons for Change
- claude-work out of credits
- More efficient direct collaboration
- Clearer division of responsibilities
- Faster iteration on analysis

## File Cleanup Completed
- Removed claude-work focused files from `/home/ck/Documents/chiron-work-tracking/`
- Updated to direct collaboration files
- Streamlined workflow documentation

## Current Directory Structure
```
/home/ck/Documents/chiron-work-tracking/
├── crinetics-direct-collaboration.md  # Current project approach
└── work-coordination-updated.md       # Overall workflow and tasks
```

## Benefits
- **Clarity:** Clear roles and responsibilities
- **Efficiency:** No intermediate system handoffs  
- **Speed:** Direct communication and iteration
- **Focus:** Cody handles systems, Chiron handles analysis

This approach should be more effective for urgent deliverables like Crinetics ROI due tomorrow.
