# 2026-02-12: Work Setup Session

## What Happened
Set up Chiron as Cody's Summus Global work assistant. Full infrastructure buildout in one session.

## Decisions
- Work repos live on Metis at `~/aletheia/theke/summus/`, accessed via SSH (not cloned locally on worker-node)
- GitHub PAT (HTTPS) over SSH key due to work org SSO requirements
- dianoia is DEAD. Scrubbed from all references.
- Metis IPs: `.19` (USB ethernet, preferred), `.20` (WiFi). Old `.17` gone.
- Bootstrap repo redesigned: toolchain installer became Claude Code enhancement package for the team
- Repo doc pattern: README.md (human) + CLAUDE.md (AI) at root of every repo. All scattered _CLAUDE.md, _llms.txt, _CHANGELOG.md removed.

## Infrastructure Built
- `bin/safe-git`: blocks push, identity changes, force push
- `bin/safe-sql`: read-only Redshift via AWS Data API, blocks all mutations
- AWS CLI v2 installed on worker-node
- Redshift connected (cluster: redshiftprovisionedclusterprod4f345b07-ld9zzlmyebs3, db: dev, user: summusredshiftprovisionedadmin)
- GitHub PAT on both worker-node and Metis (`~/.git-credentials-work`)
- All 6 repos cloned on Metis; summus-workspace promoted to summus/ root
- TASKS.md created for work task tracking
- Taskwarrior tasks 25-29 for active work items
- Cron reminders: Thu 9am (Feb 13 deadlines), Sun 9am + Mon 9am (Feb 17 deadlines)

## Bootstrap Redesign
- From 60+ files to 24 files
- Knowledge graph: SQLite default, FalkorDB option, both from same build_graph.py
- Slash commands: /schema, /query, /context, /graph
- Persistent memory via markdown (no database)
- Safety hooks: redshift-guard.sh, sql-check.sh
- Tools: schema_lookup.py, query_redshift.sh
- Audience: two technical peers using Claude Code with data_landscape and reporting

## Active Tasks
1. UCSF data pull: Transfer to COE field for Darcie (due EOD Feb 13)
2. Round robin doc review for Avery (due before 12:30am Feb 13)
3. ROI deck: 850 EE financial services for Donnie/Chris (due EOD Mon Feb 17, $7/$13 illustrative PEPM tiers)
4. SMS 360 dashboard update for James (due EOD Mon Feb 17)
5. Security software with Sanders (Mon Feb 17)

## Corrections
- Cody called me Demi, corrected to Chiron
- $150k is total deal size (includes journeys), not salary. Actual PEPM lower than $14.71.

## Preferences Confirmed
- No em dashes in writing
- Terse human commit messages, zero AI indicators
- No AI tropes (comprehensive, robust, enhance, etc.)

## Open Threads
- Dashboard _CLAUDE.md files in reporting/dashboards/ still exist (pending decision)
- build_graph.py not yet tested against real schema DB on Metis
- AWS session tokens expire, need refresh workflow
- No actual analytics work started yet
