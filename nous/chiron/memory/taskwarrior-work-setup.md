# Taskwarrior Work Setup - Chiron
**Date:** 2026-01-29

## Current Configuration
- **Data Location:** `/home/syn/.task` (shared with Syn)
- **Current Work Project:** `project:work` (7 tasks added)
- **Access:** Syn has full visibility into my work task tracking

## Task Organization Strategy
- **Namespace:** Use `project:work` for all work-related tasks
- **Tags:** Specific tags for work domains (data, github, dashboard, production, etc.)
- **Priorities:** H/M/L aligned with work urgency
- **Separation:** Work tasks clearly distinguished from personal/other projects

## Current Work Tasks (as of 2026-01-29)
```

```

## Coordination with Syn
- **Visibility:** Syn can see all my work tasks via shared task database
- **Reporting:** Weekly status updates include task progress
- **Escalation:** Blocked or urgent items flagged through task priorities
- **Cross-domain:** Work load impacts on school/personal tracked through task volume

## Benefits of This Approach
- Syn maintains orchestration visibility
- Work domain autonomy preserved  
- Task priorities align with business needs
- Clear separation from other life domains
- Audit trail for work progress tracking
