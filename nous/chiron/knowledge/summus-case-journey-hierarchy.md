# Summus: Engagement → Case → Journey Hierarchy

*Clarified by Cody 2026-01-30*

## Definitions

### Engagement
- Single interaction/touchpoint with Summus
- Examples: SMD consult, RSO (remote second opinion) interaction
- Must cost Summus money / be a true member touchpoint
- Does NOT include things like MX team emails

### Case
- The narrowed scope of a member's reason for reaching out
- Example: "ACL tear - wants RSO"
- **1 Case → Many Engagements**
- **1 Engagement → 1 Case only**

### Journey (newer concept)
- Multiple related cases for a member within the same condition pathway/domain
- Example: ACL tear case + follow-up knee surgery case = 1 MSK journey
- Allows for strategic view of member/Summus interactions
- **1 Journey → Many Cases**
- **1 Case → 1 Journey only**

## Hierarchy

```
Journey (condition pathway level)
├── Case 1 (initial reason)
│   ├── Engagement 1
│   ├── Engagement 2
│   └── Engagement 3
└── Case 2 (related follow-up)
    ├── Engagement 1
    └── Engagement 2
```

## Pricing Implications

- **PEPM pricing**: Based on case/engagement-level utilization
- **Journey pricing**: Flat rate (e.g., $6,500 for oncology journey) for bundled multi-case experience
- Standard ROI model uses PEPM; journey pricing is different unit of analysis

## ROI Model Note

The current prospect ROI methodology calculates savings at case level through BoB data:
- CTP rates, avoided visits, productivity = case-level outcomes
- Journey pricing would require different framework (not currently built)
