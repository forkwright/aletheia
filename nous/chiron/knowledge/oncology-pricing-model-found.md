# Oncology Pricing Model Found - Context for Chris (Finance) Comment
**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Discovery:** Health program pricing model with oncology-specific rates

## Key Discovery: Chris (Finance) Was Right

**Found in:** `data_landscape/sql/_imports/health_programs_roi_load.sql`

### Health Program Pricing Model (The Sophisticated Approach)

**Oncology Pricing:**
- **Oncology:** $6,500.00 per journey (standard rate across most clients)  
- **Oncology Preventative:** $1,500.00 per journey
- **Other programs for comparison:**
  - MSK: $2,200.00 per journey
  - Heart Health: $3,500.00 per journey
  - IBS: $1,900.00 per journey

### vs. Current RBC Analysis (Standard PEPM Approach)
- **Current RBC analysis:** $3.00 PEPM = $116,388 annual for 3,233 participants
- **If using oncology pricing:** $6,500 per oncology journey (much higher value)

## Why This Matters for RBC Bearings

**RBC's oncology profile:**
- **21.5% of medical spend** = $6.5M on oncology 
- **Highest spending category** among their conditions
- **Perfect alignment** with Summus oncology program

**Potential pricing impact:**
- Standard PEPM: $3.00 × 12 × 3,233 = $116,388/year
- Health program: $6,500 per oncology journey (much higher per-case value)

## Context: Chris (Finance) Knowledge

**Important background:**
- Chris involvement is NEW (previous sales person left company)
- Chris may be aware of health program pricing from finance data loading
- His "standard price" comment suggests awareness of this more sophisticated model
- Finance team has been loading health program pricing data (see SQL load scripts)

## Strategic Implications

**Chris likely knows:**
1. There's a more sophisticated pricing model available
2. Oncology cases command $6,500 per journey pricing
3. RBC's oncology burden (21.5% spend) justifies premium pricing
4. Current analysis using $3.00 PEPM may undervalue the opportunity

**This is why he mentioned "standard price"** - he's aware the flat PEPM rate doesn't reflect the true value/pricing potential for oncology-heavy populations like RBC.

## Recommendation

**For tomorrow's presentation:**
- Acknowledge the pricing sophistication available  
- Present current $3.00 PEPM analysis as baseline
- Mention health program pricing as alternative for oncology-focused value
- Let Chris guide which approach he prefers

**Chris (Finance) is more sophisticated than expected** - he's aware of the advanced pricing models.
