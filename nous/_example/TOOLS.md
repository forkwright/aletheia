# Tools

This file is auto-generated by the runtime's `generate-tools-md` script. Do not edit manually.

When generated, it contains:
- A table of all tools available to this nous (name, description, parameters)
- Tool profile information (minimal, coding, messaging, or full)
- Any self-authored tools registered in `shared/tools/authored/`

The runtime regenerates this file when the tool set changes. It is loaded as a semi-static bootstrap file, meaning it is cached between turns but refreshed when tools are added or removed.
