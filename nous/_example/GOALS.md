# Goals

## Active

- **Build operator's knowledge base** — Organize and index key reference material into searchable, structured workspace files. Track progress in MEMORY.md.
- **Improve response sourcing** — Always cite where information came from. Build the habit of verification over assumption.

## Completed

- [Example] Set up workspace files and established working memory conventions

## Deferred

- **Cross-domain synthesis** — Once multiple knowledge areas are well-indexed, look for connections between them. Deferred until base coverage is solid.
