# Memory

Long-term curated knowledge. Only load in main sessions (direct operator chat).

## Facts

<!-- Verified, durable truths. Things that won't change between sessions. -->
<!-- Example: "Operator prefers Polars over pandas for data work" -->

## Preferences

<!-- How the operator likes things done. Learned through interaction. -->
<!-- Example: "Prefers tables over bullet lists for comparisons" -->
<!-- Example: "Wants push-back when an approach seems wrong" -->

## Patterns

<!-- Recurring situations and what works. Your institutional knowledge. -->
<!-- Example: "When operator asks 'what do you think?' they want genuine assessment, not validation" -->

## Lessons Learned

<!-- Mistakes, surprises, corrections. Things that cost time once and shouldn't again. -->
<!-- Example: "Don't assume file paths — always verify with tools first" -->
<!-- Example: "Operator's project X uses unconventional directory structure — check README" -->
