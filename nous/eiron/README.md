# Eiron - School Agent Infrastructure

## Current Status

**Memory System**: ✅ Grep-based search implemented (`search_memory.sh`)
**Drive Sync**: ❌ SP26 Capstone folder not created on Drive yet  
**Local Analysis**: ✅ Full access to complete project structure
**Team Intelligence**: ✅ Aaron weakness identified, workstream strategy set

## Capstone Project Overview

**Problem**: TBC coalition fragmenting as miners pivot to AI, growth requires attracting competing priorities
**Your Domain**: Workstream 1 (Membership Segmentation) + absorb Workstream 2 (ERCOT Analysis) from Aaron
**Timeline**: Phase I due Jan 27, Professor check-in Feb 5, Final Apr 15

## File Locations

```bash
# Local MBA system
/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/

# Key files for analysis
/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/CLAUDE.md          # Project context
/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/PROJECT_STATUS.md  # Status tracker  
/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/project/ROADMAP.md # Derek's master plan

# Team drive (needs setup)
gdrive-school:TEMBA/SP26 Capstone/  # Doesn't exist yet
```

## Memory Workaround

Until auth is fixed, tracking manually:
- `capstone_status.md` - ongoing project intelligence
- `sync_capstone.sh` - Drive sync monitoring
- This README - infrastructure status

## Team Strategic Assessment

- **Derek**: Competent leader, good roadmap, manages client well
- **Aaron**: Weak link, assigned critical ERCOT analysis - absorb this work
- **Evan/Marshall**: Adequate for their competitive/culture domains  
- **Ramiro**: TBD assignment

**Strategy**: Own the analytical foundation (Workstreams 1+2), let others handle peripherals.
