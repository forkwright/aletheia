# 2026-02-09 — Session Log (spans Feb 8-9)

## Context
Cody had a family emergency on Feb 8. Needed ACF homework completed without bandwidth to do it himself. Feb 9 morning pivoted to Strategic Management assignments due same day.

## What Was Discussed

### ACF Homework 1 (Feb 8)
- Pulled Canvas file export + teammate Sarah-Michelle's attempt from Metis Downloads
- Organized all ACF course materials into `theke/chrematistike/sp26/acf/` (articles, class_notes/capital_structure, class_notes/info_risk_mgmt, homework/hw1, admin)
- Worked all 5 questions: M&M arbitrage, Prop II graphs, G&T 14.2/14.3, senior debt claim dilution, diversification/spin-offs
- Built formula-driven Excel workbook with embedded charts for Q2
- Reviewed Sarah-Michelle's handwritten attempt (4 pages, scanned images)

### Metis Connectivity (Feb 8)
- Discovered Metis IP changed from 192.168.0.17 to 192.168.0.21 (DHCP)
- Tailscale ping works, SSH via tailscale IP times out, but LAN .21 works
- First time gaining SSH access as `ck` user (not just `syn`)

### Canvas Access (Feb 9)
- Browser tool can reach Canvas (headless Chrome on worker-node)
- UT EID login: ck29657 — successfully entered credentials
- Duo MFA: Cody prefers phone call option over push notification
- Phone call initiated but session likely timed out during compaction

### Strategic Management (Feb 9)
- 4 items due today at 6 PM: Value Generation Mini-Sim, Merck Mini-Case, Stakeholders Mini-Sim, Team Selection
- Canvas login attempted but Duo MFA timed out — Cody said "didn't pan out"
- Pivoted to Merck Mini-Case via screenshot workflow (Cody sends screenshots, I transcribe + analyze)
- Transcribed full Merck case (Rothaermel pp. 21-22): Mectizan vs Vioxx stakeholder strategy contrast
- Saved to `theke/chrematistike/sp26/strategic_mgmt/homework/merck_mini_case.md`
- Analyzed through Ritchie-Dunham's Value Impact framework:
  - Mectizan: purpose-profit alignment worked (free drug, eradicated river blindness, 1B treatments)
  - Vioxx: purpose-profit inversion ($57B value destruction > Vioxx NPV)
  - Key insight: Merck defined value FOR patients in both cases rather than asking — worked when need obvious (Mectizan), failed when harm invisible without patient input (Vioxx)
- Relevant lecture slides extracted: perceived value = value received/cost, stakeholder engagement continuum
- Quiz questions incoming at compaction — not yet received

## What Was Decided
- Excel with formulas (not hardcoded) is the standard for homework going forward
- Canvas browser access is viable for future assignments
- Metis should be accessed via 192.168.0.21 (not .17)

## What's Pending
- **URGENT**: Merck Mini-Case quiz questions — Cody about to send, analysis prepped
- **URGENT**: 3 other BA 388T items due today Feb 9 at 6 PM (Value Gen Mini-Sim, Stakeholders Mini-Sim, Team Selection)
- Canvas access not established (Duo MFA timed out, Cody moved on)
- SSH config for Metis should be updated to .21

## Corrections Made
- Sarah-Michelle Q1b: wrong approach (borrowing alone can't fix ownership fraction change after deleveraging — needs to buy 5 shares + borrow $40)
- Deadline schedule updated from stale Jan dates to current Todoist data

## Key Files
- `theke/chrematistike/sp26/acf/homework/hw1/Kickertz_HW1_ACF.xlsx` — completed HW1
- `theke/chrematistike/sp26/acf/homework/hw1/Sarah-Michelle Finance HW 1.pdf` — teammate attempt
- `memory/deadlines/sp26-schedule.md` — updated deadline schedule

## Teammate Assessment: Sarah-Michelle
- Strong: Q3 (14.2/14.3), Q4 (senior debt) — correct answers
- Weak: Q1b (conceptual error), Q2 (graphs only, no equations)
- Incomplete: Q3d, Q5c-d cut off / not attempted
