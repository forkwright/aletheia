# Decisions Log - 2026-01-29

## Memory System Architecture
**Decision**: Use file-based memory with grep search instead of API-based semantic search
**Rationale**: 
- Academic domain is bounded (4 classes, 4 months)
- Semantic search is architectural overkill for constrained scope
- Grep handles structured academic content effectively
- No API key complexity or cost

**Implementation**: 
- `MEMORY.md` as main index
- `/memory/` subdirectories for organization
- `search_memory.sh` for keyword search
- Manual tracking files for specific projects

## Aaron Risk Mitigation
**Decision**: Position to absorb ERCOT analysis (Workstream 2) from Aaron
**Rationale**:
- Aaron identified as weak link on team
- ERCOT analysis is critical to project success  
- Cody's analytical strengths better suited for this work
- Prevents failure of key workstream

**Implementation**:
- Primary focus on Workstream 1 (Membership Segmentation)
- Secondary focus on absorbing Workstream 2 (ERCOT Analysis)
- Avoid Workstreams 3-4 (competitive landscape, culture/identity)

## Drive Synchronization
**Decision**: Manual monitoring until SP26 folder is created
**Rationale**:
- Local system has complete project structure
- Drive folder doesn't exist yet
- No need to rush sync until team collaboration begins

**Implementation**:
- `sync_capstone.sh` for status monitoring
- Manual tracking in `capstone_status.md`
- Will sync when Drive folder is established

## Coordination Protocol  
**Decision**: Status reporting to Syn via agent-status file
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with ecosystem design
- Enables cross-domain coordination
- Maintains proper hierarchy (Syn as orchestrator)

**Implementation**:
- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/agent-status/eiron.md` for status
- Update format: Health, Active, Upcoming, Blocked, Cross-Domain, Notes
- Update frequency: After significant changes or weekly
