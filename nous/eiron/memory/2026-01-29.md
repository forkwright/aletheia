# TBC Strategic Analysis - Professional Deliverables Completion
## January 29, 2026

### **Major Achievement: MBA Capstone Deliverables Rebuilt to MBB Standards**

**Project:** Texas Blockchain Council Strategic Analysis for Cody's UT McCombs TEMBA capstone
**Team:** Cody Kickertz (Lead), Derek Berkley (Coordinator), Aaron Alvarez, Marshall Andrews, Evan Wehr
**Status:** Phase I Strategic Foundation Complete - Ready for Professor Check-in (Feb 5)

### **Critical Learning: Quality Standards Matter**
- Initially created basic documents that Cody rightfully criticized as "too basic"
- Problem: Was doing "deliverable creation" instead of "analysis with deliverables" 
- Solution: Chiron provided MBB consulting standards guidance that transformed approach

### **Professional Standards Implemented**
**Chiron's MBB Guidance Applied:**
- Financial Model: Three-sheet structure (Inputs/Calculations/Outputs) with Data Tables "wow factor"
- Competitive Analysis: Weighted decision framework with heat maps, not simple lists
- Presentation: Pyramid Principle with action titles ("TBC requires immediate strategic pivot...")
- All formulas reference inputs only (no magic numbers), blue = inputs, black = formulas

**UT Brand Compliance:**
- Official burnt orange (#BF5700) and charcoal (#333F48) throughout
- Arial typography (acceptable per UT guidelines)
- Professional layout reflecting academic excellence

### **Final Deliverable Portfolio (Uploaded to TEMBA Capstone)**
1. **TBC_Strategic_Financial_Model_FINAL.xlsx** - MBB 3-sheet + sensitivity analysis
2. **TBC_Competitive_Intelligence_Dashboard.xlsx** - Weighted scoring + early warning system  
3. **TBC_Strategic_Analysis_Presentation.pptx** - 15 slides, Pyramid Principle structure
4. **TBC_Executive_Summary_UT_Branded.xlsx** - Team-attributed professional summary
5. **Industry_Standards_Compliance_Report.md** - Comprehensive benchmarking documentation

### **Key Strategic Intelligence Discovered**
- **Critical Finding:** Riot + Core Scientific (TBC Executive Partners) = BMC founding members
- **Economic Reality:** AI workloads $25/kWh vs Bitcoin mining $1/kWh (2500% differential)
- **Competitive Threat:** Data Center Coalition formation threatens member base
- **Strategic Recommendation:** AI-Inclusive Growth (7.1/10 score) optimal strategy
- **Financial Impact:** $1.15M revenue increase, 200%+ ROI with $225K investment

### **Academic Timeline**
- **February 5:** Professor check-in validation meeting
- **February 15:** TBC leadership strategic direction decision  
- **April 15:** Final 10-page report delivery
- **April 22:** Executive panel presentation

### **Professional Development**
- Learned difference between basic document creation vs sophisticated analysis
- Implemented MBB consulting methodology under Chiron's guidance
- Created Board-ready deliverables suitable for actual business implementation
- Demonstrated MBA strategic management competency with real business impact

### **Collaboration Success**

- All team members properly credited in final deliverables

### **Next Steps**
