# 2026-02-04 - Phase 2 Deliverables Completed

## What Happened
Discovered SWOT and competitive analysis files from Feb 2 were missing (either subagent write failures or lost in cleanup). Rebuilt both from scratch using fresh Perplexity research.

## Deliverables Created

### Competitive Analysis
- **Location:** `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/project/research/competitive/competitive_analysis.md`
- **Peer orgs analyzed:** Blockchain Association, Satoshi Action Fund, Bitcoin Mining Council, Chamber of Digital Commerce
- **Key finding:** BMC already has TBC's top Executive Partners (Riot, Core Scientific, MARA) as members - extreme retention risk

### SWOT Analysis
- **Location:** `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/project/analysis/swot/tbc_swot_analysis.md`
- **Core strategic question:** Can TBC expand beyond Bitcoin advocacy without losing foundational identity?
- **Recommended direction:** "Hub and spoke" strategy - Bitcoin core + AI/HPC and financial services spokes

### Regulatory Summary
- **Location:** `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/mba/sp26/capstone/project/research/regulatory/texas_crypto_regulations.md`
- **Key laws:** SB6 (large load registration), HB 4474, HB 1576, SB 1457, HB 1666
- **Active litigation:** TBC v. IRS broker rules (N.D. Texas)

## Key Strategic Insights

### TBC's Unique Advantages
1. Texas-specific policy expertise (no competitor replicates)
2. ERCOT grid strategy knowledge
3. NABA national platform while maintaining Texas focus

### Critical Threats
1. **Bitcoin Mining Council overlap** - Riot, Core Scientific, MARA already members
2. **Satoshi Action Fund** - proven state-level model could expand to Texas
3. **Industry consolidation** - M&A reducing membership base
4. **Mining economics** - margin pressure on core revenue sources

### Recommended Strategy
"Hub and Spoke" model:
- **Hub:** Maintain Bitcoin mining advocacy core
- **Spokes:** AI/HPC, Financial Services, Developer working groups
- **Organizing principle:** Texas regulatory expertise across all sectors

## Feb 5 Touchpoint Status
- Derek leads progress briefing with professor
- All Phase 2 deliverables complete and uploaded
- Ready for check-in

## Lesson Learned
Verify subagent file writes completed successfully. The Feb 2 "completed" files didn't actually exist.
