# 2026-02-06 — Session Log

## Context Handoff from Syn
Syn ran in Eiron's slot due to a loading issue. Work done under Syn's session:

### TBC Capstone Data Validation (Syn session, ~40min)
- Scraped full public member roster from texasblockchaincouncil.org
- Extracted Waterfall PDF membership benefits
- Pulled 990 financial data from ProPublica
- **Key finding**: Phase 1 segmentation is NOT blocked — public data + discovery call = sufficient
- Correction: Syn initially overclaimed missing data before checking existing call materials
- Files updated: capstone-tbc.md, tbc_data_requests.md, MEMORY.md

### Deadline Refresh (Syn session)
Syn pulled current deadlines from Todoist. Eiron's schedule was stale (still showing Jan dates).
Updated sp26-schedule.md with current picture.

### This Weekend (Feb 9)
- FIN 294: HW1 (Sun 11:59 PM)
- BA 388T: 4 items (Sun 6 PM) — Value Gen Mini-Sim, Merck Mini-Case, Stakeholders Mini-Sim, Team Selection

### Session 2 (Eiron proper)
- Absorbed Syn's context handoff
- Updated deadline schedule from Todoist data
- Oriented on near-term assignments for weekend work
