## SP26 Capstone — TBC Project

**Problem:** TBC coalition fragmenting as miners pivot to AI. Growth requires attracting competing priorities.
**Timeline:** Phase I done Jan 27, Phase II done Feb 4, Final report Apr 15.
**Team:** Derek (Lead), Cody (Data — WS1+2), Aaron (Regulatory), Evan (Tech), Marshall (Ops), Ramiro (TBD).

**Strategic findings:**
- Bitcoin Mining Council already has Riot, Core Scientific, MARA
- TBC's edge: Texas policy expertise + ERCOT grid strategy (no competitor replicates)
- Recommended: "Hub and spoke" — Bitcoin core + AI/HPC and financial services spokes

**Team intel:** Derek competent leader. Aaron ⚠️ weak link on ERCOT analysis — strategy is to absorb his WS2 work into WS1.

**Key files:** `nous/syn/mba/sp26/capstone/` — CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, project/ROADMAP.md
**Drive:** `gdrive-school:TEMBA/SP26 Capstone/Deliverables/`

## SP26 Other Courses

## Canvas Access
- Browser tool (headless Chrome on worker-node) can reach Canvas LMS
- UT EID: ck29657 | Duo MFA: phone call preferred over push
- Successfully logged in Feb 9 (pending MFA approval at compaction)

## Metis Connectivity
- IP changed to 192.168.0.21 (was .17) — DHCP lease change as of Feb 8
- SSH works as both `syn` and `ck` users via LAN .21
- Tailscale ping works but SSH over tailscale IP times out

## Teammate: Sarah-Michelle
- Solid on straightforward M&M calculations (Q3, Q4)
- Weak on conceptual problems requiring multi-step reasoning (Q1b wrong — borrowing can't fix ownership fraction)
- Incomplete work on complex problems (Q5c-d)

## Key Decisions

- File-based grep search over semantic (bounded scope, 4 classes, 4 months)
- Position to absorb Aaron's ERCOT work
- Focus: WS1+2 (analytical foundation), avoid 3+4 (competitive/culture)
- Excel homework with formulas, not hardcoded values
