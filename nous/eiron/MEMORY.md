## SP26 Capstone — TBC Project

**Problem:** TBC coalition fragmenting as miners pivot to AI. Growth requires attracting competing priorities.
**Timeline:** Phase I done Jan 27, Phase II done Feb 4, Final report Apr 15.
**Team:** Derek (Lead), Cody (Data — WS1+2), Aaron (Regulatory), Evan (Tech), Marshall (Ops), Ramiro (TBD).

**Strategic findings:**
- Bitcoin Mining Council already has Riot, Core Scientific, MARA
- TBC's edge: Texas policy expertise + ERCOT grid strategy (no competitor replicates)
- Recommended: "Hub and spoke" — Bitcoin core + AI/HPC and financial services spokes

**Team intel:** Derek competent leader. Aaron ⚠️ weak link on ERCOT analysis — strategy is to absorb his WS2 work into WS1.

**Key files:** `nous/syn/mba/sp26/capstone/` — CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, project/ROADMAP.md
**Drive:** `gdrive-school:TEMBA/SP26 Capstone/Deliverables/`

## SP26 Other Courses

- **Advanced Corporate Finance** (Almazan)
- **Strategic Management** (Ritchie-Dunham)
- **Managerial Macroeconomics**

## Key Decisions

- File-based grep search over semantic (bounded scope, 4 classes, 4 months)
- Position to absorb Aaron's ERCOT work
- Focus: WS1+2 (analytical foundation), avoid 3+4 (competitive/culture)
