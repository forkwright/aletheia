# TBC Member Acquisition Strategy Framework

*Based on ERCOT voting analysis and competitive intelligence*

## Strategic Acquisition Priorities

### Priority 1: ERCOT Vote Optimization
**Objective**: Maximize voting power efficiency while maintaining revenue sustainability

**Target Profile**: 
- Texas-based crypto operations 1-50 MW
- Currently unaffiliated with trade associations
- Registered with PUC as large flexible load (when FOIA data arrives)

**Rationale**: Stephen's discovery call insight - "Brad [1 MW miner] is just as important as Jason [large miner CEO] for ERCOT influence" due to 1 vote per entity structure

**Acquisition Method**:
- Use PUC FOIA response to identify unaffiliated operations
- Position TBC as ERCOT voting coalition (unique value proposition)
- Offer Strategic tier ($25K) - Stephen's confirmed "sweet spot"
- Emphasize grid policy influence vs pure advocacy

### Priority 2: AI Transition Defense
**Objective**: Retain transitioning members, prevent Data Center Coalition capture

**Target Profile**:
- Current TBC members planning mining-to-AI transition
- Large miners with facility flexibility (Core Scientific, Riot pattern)
- New AI/HPC entrants with Texas operations

**Immediate Risk Assessment**:
- Riot Platforms: Already transitioning (Jessi: "sold Bitcoin for hyperscale")
- Core Scientific: GPU clusters operational
- Marathon Digital: Evaluating diversification
- Unknown: How many other Executive Partners have transition plans?

**Retention Strategy**:
- Develop AI/HPC policy expertise before competitors
- Frame as "Texas energy infrastructure" vs abandoning Bitcoin
- Offer transition-specific services (AI regulation, data center policy)
- Maintain Bitcoin advocacy track for identity comfort

### Priority 3: Sector Expansion (Giovanni's Vision)
**Objective**: Implement "if you're working in technology in this state, you're really a part of us"

**Target Sectors**:
- **Financial Services**: Regional banks with blockchain initiatives
- **Energy Infrastructure**: Grid operators, renewable developers
- **Fintech**: Payment rails, stablecoin issuers (Jessi's examples)
- **Software Development**: Blockchain/crypto application developers

**Acquisition Approach**:
- Create sector-specific value propositions
- Develop tiered membership options (including "Rolodex access" bespoke)
- Partner with existing Texas tech associations for credibility
- Position as Texas business network with policy expertise

## Geographic Acquisition Strategy

### Texas Market Penetration
**Primary Focus**: Maximize in-state ERCOT representation

**Data Sources**:
- PUC FOIA response (expected January 24): Companies ≥75 MW crypto operations
- ERCOT participant lists: Industrial Consumer and Independent Generator segments
- Texas energy industry directories
- Local business development corporation listings

**Market Sizing Framework** (Pending FOIA Data):
- If 50 companies identified → 30-40 potential targets (assuming 20% current TBC membership)
- If 500 companies identified → 300-400 targets (significant expansion opportunity)
- If 5,000 companies identified → Market saturation strategy needed

### Out-of-State Strategy
**Secondary Focus**: Strategic partnerships and influence expansion

**Target Criteria**:
- Companies with Texas operations or expansion plans
- Multi-state operators where Texas is significant facility
- Organizations seeking Texas market entry

**Partnership Opportunities**:
- NABA coordination (leverage Jessi's ED role)
- Other state blockchain associations
- Regional energy infrastructure organizations
