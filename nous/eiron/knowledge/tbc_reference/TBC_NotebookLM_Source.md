# TBC Strategic Analysis: Board Decision Document

## Executive Summary

The Texas Blockchain Council faces a critical strategic decision. The Texas energy-intensive computing market is transforming rapidly, with AI/HPC facilities now comprising over 70% of new large load interconnection requests to ERCOT. TBC must decide whether to expand services to capture this growth or maintain Bitcoin-focused positioning as the market shifts.

**Key Finding:** TBC's highest-value Executive Partner members (Riot Platforms, Core Scientific) are already transitioning their business models toward AI/HPC workloads and maintain dual membership with the Bitcoin Mining Council. The competitive window for TBC to establish position in the broader energy computing market is approximately 90 days before likely formation of a dedicated Data Center Coalition.

**Recommendation:** Expand TBC's scope to serve all energy-intensive computing operations in Texas, with immediate focus on retaining transitioning Executive Partners and launching AI/HPC policy services.

## Market Context: The Texas Energy Computing Explosion

### ERCOT Large Load Requests (2025)
- **225 large load interconnection requests** received through November 2025
- This compares to **152 total requests for 2022-2024 combined** — a 4x increase
- **Over 70% of these requests are data centers**, primarily AI/HPC facilities
- **220+ gigawatts** of projects have requested connection by 2030

### What's Driving This?
1. **AI compute demand explosion** — Major hyperscalers and AI companies need massive power capacity
2. **Texas advantages** — Deregulated market, available land, relative grid flexibility
3. **Mining infrastructure convergence** — Existing Bitcoin mining facilities have power infrastructure suitable for AI/HPC conversion

### The Economics
- AI/HPC workloads generate approximately **$25 revenue per kWh consumed**
- Bitcoin mining generates approximately **$1 revenue per kWh consumed**
- This **25x differential** makes business model transition economically inevitable for many facility operators

## Competitive Landscape: Current and Emerging Threats

### Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC)
- **Founded:** May 2021
- **Focus:** Sustainability metrics, ESG narrative for Bitcoin mining
- **Key fact:** Riot Platforms and Core Scientific are **founding members**
- **Threat level:** Medium — different positioning but competes for mindshare and resources from TBC's top members

### Blockchain Association
- **Growth:** 180% member increase in recent period
- **Focus:** National policy advocacy, DC-focused
- **Texas presence:** Limited but expanding
- **Threat level:** Low-Medium — national scope may attract members seeking broader influence

### Data Center Coalition (Forming)
- **Status:** Not yet formalized, but Stephen Graddy identified as near-term competitive threat
- **Likely timing:** Q1-Q2 2026
- **Focus:** Texas AI/HPC data center policy advocacy
- **Threat level:** HIGH — would directly compete for TBC's transitioning members with purpose-built offering

### Satoshi Action Fund
- **Focus:** State-level "Right to Mine" legislation
- **Track record:** Success in 4 states
- **Texas timeline:** 2027 legislative session
- **Threat level:** Low — complementary rather than competitive, but could position as "pure Bitcoin" alternative

## Member Transition Reality

### Executive Partners Moving to AI/HPC

**Core Scientific**
- Already has 12-year HPC hosting contracts with CoreWeave
- Deploying 120 MW of additional GPU infrastructure
- Expansion operational in second half of 2026
- TBC membership: Executive tier ($50K+)

**Riot Platforms**
- Began AI-ready construction in late 2025
- First AI data center building operational 2027
- Corsicana facility designed for operational flexibility
- TBC membership: Executive tier ($50K+)

### Implications for TBC
- Combined revenue at risk: **~$100,000 annually** from just these two members
- If TBC doesn't serve their evolving needs, they have alternatives (BMC already, Data Center Coalition forming)
- Early engagement and retention critical before alternatives mature

## Strategic Options for Board Discussion

### Option A: Maintain Bitcoin Focus
**Description:** Continue current positioning as Bitcoin/crypto advocacy organization. Accept that transitioning members may reduce engagement or depart. Focus on attracting new Bitcoin-only operations.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ Clear identity and mission coherence
- ✓ Avoids organizational complexity
- ✗ Potential membership losses as large miners transition
- ✗ Smaller addressable market as industry evolves
- ✗ May be seen as obsolete if market fully transitions

### Option B: Expand to Energy-Intensive Computing
**Description:** Broaden scope to include AI/HPC data center advocacy. Develop policy services for emerging market (ERCOT interconnection, permitting, grid policy). Position as "Texas Energy Infrastructure Council" voice.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ Captures growing market segment (70%+ of new large loads)
- ✓ Retains transitioning members and attracts new entrants
- ✓ First-mover advantage in Texas AI/HPC policy
- ✗ Requires capability development
- ✗ Potential identity dilution for Bitcoin purists
- ✗ Higher investment required

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Description:** Maintain Bitcoin advocacy as core identity. Create separate working group or division for AI/HPC policy. Allow members to engage with relevant services based on their operations.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ Preserves current identity while enabling growth
- ✓ Provides transition path for evolving members
- ✗ More complex organizational structure
- ✗ May satisfy neither audience fully
- ✗ Resource allocation challenges

## Financial Projections by Scenario

### Current State
- Executive tier members: 6 at $50K = $300K
- Strategic tier members: 15 at $25K = $375K
- Total estimated revenue: $675K

### Scenario A: Bitcoin Focus (Conservative)
- Executive retention: 75% (lose some transitioning members)
- New Strategic members: +10 (Bitcoin-only segment)
- Projected revenue: $825K (+22%)

### Scenario B: Energy Computing Expansion (Growth)

## Risk Factors

### Competitor Formation Risk
- **Risk:** Data Center Coalition announces before TBC establishes position
- **Mitigation:** Accelerate AI/HPC launch; secure member commitments early
- **Likelihood:** High if TBC delays beyond Q1 2026

### Member Defection Risk
- **Risk:** Executive Partner departure during transition period
- **Mitigation:** Retention conversations with clear value proposition
- **Likelihood:** Medium if TBC maintains Bitcoin-only positioning

### Execution Capacity Risk
- **Risk:** Staff bandwidth insufficient for dual-track operation
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout; consider contract support
- **Likelihood:** Medium without additional resources

## The Decision Before the Board

**The core question:** Does TBC want to grow with its members as they evolve, or maintain purity as the market shifts around it?

**Timeline:** Decision needed within 30 days to enable positioning before competitive alternatives organize.

**Success measure:** By April 2026, TBC should have written retention commitments from all Executive Partners currently planning AI transitions, and a launched AI/HPC policy service before any competing coalition formalizes.
