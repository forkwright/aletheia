# ERCOT Policy Influence Analysis 

*Absorbing Aaron's critical workstream with quantitative rigor*

## Stephen's Strategic Framework (Discovery Call)

**Quote**: "aircott voting power and representing a larger share of the policy makers and voters"

**Context**: Stephen positioned ERCOT influence as TBC's #1 priority:
- "the regulatory bodies are different than like the statehouse"
- "Ercot and PUC, those regulatory bodies, we do need influence in"  
- "when rulemaking process begins, that's where we need our members to plug in and have a seat at the table"

## ERCOT Governance Structure

### **Board of Directors (Policy Level)**
- **Total**: 12 Directors (8 voting, 4 non-voting ex officio)
- **Composition**: 8 independent members + 4 ex officio (CEO, PUC Chair, PUC Commissioner, Public Counsel)
- **TBC Access**: Indirect via market segment representation

### **Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) - Primary Influence Point**
- **Function**: Makes policy recommendations to Board
- **Structure**: Market segment representatives + consumer representatives
- **Meeting Frequency**: Monthly
- **Subcommittees**: 4 major (PRS, ROS, RMS, WMS) + numerous working groups

### **Market Segments (Key Insight)**
ERCOT operates through defined market segments with representation rights:
- **Independent Generator** (where some miners participate)
- **Independent REP** (retail electric providers)  
- **Industrial Consumer** (where most crypto miners likely fall)
- **Load Serving Entity**
- **Transmission/Distribution Service Provider**

## TBC's ERCOT Strategy Analysis

### **Current Position Assessment**
Based on Stephen's PUC FOIA request (due ~Jan 24):
- **Target Data**: Companies operating ≥75 MW crypto operations in Texas
- **Strategic Value**: "large flexible load perspective with the PEC [PUC]"
- **Intelligence Gap**: Don't know if list will be "50 or 5,000" companies

### **Quantity vs Quality Strategy** 

**Stephen's Core Insight**: "Can't do 80-20. We need all members because we need votes. Brad [1 MW miner] is just as important as Jason [large miner CEO] for ERCOT influence."

#### **Voting Mechanism Analysis**
| Strategy | Member Profile | Votes per MW | Durability | Risk |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|------|
| **Many Small** | 100 miners × 5 MW each | 500 individual votes | High durability | Lower individual flight risk |
| **Few Large** | 1 miner × 500 MW | 1 consolidated vote | Low durability | High concentration risk |

#### **Competitive Threat: Data Center Coalition**
- **Risk**: AI/HPC data centers organizing separate representation
- **Impact**: Could fragment TBC's voting bloc
- **Timeline**: Immediate (AI transition accelerating in 2026)

## ERCOT Influence Quantification Framework

### **Direct Influence Metrics**
| Metric | Current TBC | Target State | Data Source |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **TAC Representatives** | Unknown | 2-3 across segments | ERCOT committee docs |
| **Subcommittee Participation** | Unknown | Active in all 4 | TAC working group lists |
| **Working Group Seats** | Unknown | Chair/co-chair positions | ERCOT stakeholder process |
| **Aggregate MW Represented** | Unknown | Quantify via FOIA | PUC response (Jan 24) |

### **Indirect Influence Metrics**
| Metric | Current TBC | Target State | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rulemaking Comments** | Ad hoc | Systematic filing | PUC docket tracking |
| **Stakeholder Coalition Building** | Individual | Lead coalitions | Cross-segment alliances |
| **Technical Expertise Access** | Limited | Subject matter experts | Member network analysis |

## Member MW Mapping (Preliminary)

### **TBC Executive Partners (Confirmed Large Load)**
- **Riot Platforms**: Rockdale 750 MW facility
- **Marathon Digital**: Major Texas operations
- **Core Scientific**: Multiple TX facilities (including AI transition)
- **Cipher Mining**: Texas-based operations
- **Bitdeer**: Texas expansion
- **Bitmain**: Rockdale facility

### **ERCOT Registration Analysis Needed**
- [ ] Cross-reference TBC members with ERCOT QSE registration
- [ ] Identify which market segments TBC members participate in
- [ ] Map representation gaps (segments without TBC members)

## Strategic Scenarios Modeling

### **Scenario 1: Bitcoin Purity** 
- **Member Focus**: Small-medium miners (1-100 MW)
- **ERCOT Value**: High vote count, durable representation
- **Risk**: Lower aggregate MW, reduced policy gravitas

### **Scenario 2: AI-Inclusive Coalition**
- **Member Focus**: Large miners transitioning to AI + new AI/HPC entrants  
- **ERCOT Value**: High aggregate MW, strong technical credibility
- **Risk**: Vote consolidation, potential defection to Data Center Coalition

### **Scenario 3: Hybrid Maximization**
- **Member Focus**: All MW sources (mining + AI/HPC + energy infrastructure)
- **ERCOT Value**: Maximum votes + maximum MW
- **Risk**: Internal tension, unclear identity, competitor advantage

## Data Requirements for Quantification

### **Critical TBC Data Needed**
- [ ] Member MW capacity by facility
- [ ] Current ERCOT market segment participation by member
- [ ] Historical TAC/subcommittee representation
- [ ] Rulemaking participation track record

### **Public Data to Gather**
- [ ] ERCOT market participant lists by segment
- [ ] TAC representative lists (current term)
- [ ] Recent rulemaking dockets with crypto/mining relevance  
- [ ] Data Center Coalition member overlap analysis

## Strategic Recommendations (Preliminary)

### **Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)**
1. **Map Current ERCOT Position**: Audit TBC members' market segment participation
2. **Analyze FOIA Response**: Quantify TAM when PUC response arrives (~Jan 24)
3. **Competitive Intelligence**: Identify Data Center Coalition membership overlap

### **Medium-term Strategy (90 Days)**
1. **Representation Strategy**: Ensure TBC members in key TAC positions  
2. **Coalition Building**: Alliance with complementary market segments
3. **Technical Capability**: Develop subject matter expertise for working groups

### **Success Metrics**
- **Representation**: TBC members in ≥3 TAC market segments
- **Participation**: Active representation on all 4 subcommittees  
- **Influence**: Lead or co-lead ≥2 working groups relevant to crypto/AI
- **Aggregate Power**: Represent ≥10% of ERCOT large flexible load

---

**Next Phase**: Quantify current TBC ERCOT position using available data, build member MW mapping, finalize voting power scenarios.

**Integration Point**: Connect ERCOT analysis to member segmentation (who has MW? which segments?) and competitive analysis (how does BMC/BA approach ERCOT?)

**Timeline**: Framework complete by Feb 3, ready for Feb 5 professor check-in
