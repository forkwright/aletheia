# TBC Member Segmentation & Economics Analysis

*Building on Stephen's discovery call insights + competitive intelligence*

## Base Data (Discovery Call Confirmed)

**Total Membership**: 175 (110 companies, 70 individuals)  
**Retention Rate**: 87% (2024), targeting 90%+  
**Revenue Pattern**: ~99.6% from program services (dues + events)

## Tier Economics (Stephen's Analysis)

### **Strategic Tier ($25K) - "Sweet Spot"**
- **Profile**: Moderate engagement, reasonable support asks
- **Value**: Most profitable tier - good revenue without high maintenance
- **Growth target**: Stephen confirmed this is ideal expansion focus

### **Executive Tier ($50K) - "High Maintenance"** 
- **Profile**: Largest individual revenue contribution
- **Support burden**: "Ask for a ton", extensive support required
- **Economics**: High revenue but high cost-to-serve

### **Startup Tier (3% revenue model) - "High Ask, Low Revenue"**
- **Profile**: Only 3% of overall TBC revenue
- **Behavior**: "Ask for a lot" - want connections with major miners
- **Economics**: Low revenue, high engagement demands
- **Strategic value**: Ecosystem growth, future potential

### **Individual Members (70 total) - "Coalition Optics"**
- **Profile**: Supporters, advocates, some industry professionals  
- **ERCOT value**: Minimal (no MW capacity)
- **Strategic value**: Coalition legitimacy, grassroots appearance

## Segmentation Framework

### **By Economic Value**
| Tier | Count Est. | Revenue Contribution | Cost to Serve | Net Value |
|------|------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Executive** | ~15-20 | High ($50K each) | Very High | Medium |
| **Strategic** | ~40-60 | Medium ($25K each) | Low-Medium | **HIGH** |
| **Startup** | ~20-30 | Very Low (3% total) | High | Low |
| **Individual** | 70 | Low ($1-5K est.) | Medium | Low-Medium |

### **By ERCOT Influence** 
| Category | Examples | MW Value | Vote Count | Strategic Importance |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Large Miners** | Riot, MARA, Core Scientific | 100-1000+ MW each | 1 vote per entity | High MW, Low vote efficiency |
| **Small Miners** | Individual operations | 1-50 MW each | 1 vote per entity | Low MW, High vote efficiency |
| **AI Transitioning** | Core Scientific GPU | Variable | 1 vote per entity | Uncertain trajectory |
| **Energy/Infrastructure** | Grid-adjacent companies | Variable | Varies | Policy alignment |
| **Financial Services** | Third Coast Bank | 0 MW | 0 votes | Value prop unclear |

### **By Competitive Risk**
| Risk Level | Profile | Vulnerable To | Retention Strategy |
|------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **🔴 EXTREME** | Large miners dual-members of BMC | Bitcoin Mining Council ESG focus | Texas-specific policy wins |
| **🟡 HIGH** | National crypto companies | Blockchain Association federal focus | ERCOT voting value, local network |
| **🟢 LOW** | Small Texas miners, local businesses | Limited alternatives | Core constituency |

## Strategic Insights from Discovery Call

### **"Bespoke Opportunity"** - Stephen's Quote
- Some members just want "access to the Rolodex" 
- Events, networking, deal-making connections
- Potential for à la carte packages vs full membership

### **Network Building "Moved Up the Ladder"**
- Members increasingly want deal facilitation, not just advocacy
- Shift from policy focus to business development
- Revenue opportunity beyond traditional dues model

### **Giovanni's Vision: "Broader Tent"**
- "If you're working in technology in this state, you're really a part of us"
- Expansion beyond blockchain/crypto to broader tech
- Opportunity: AI/HPC companies, energy tech, fintech

## Economics Model (Preliminary)

### **Revenue Optimization**
- **Strategic Tier Expansion**: Focus growth on $25K sweet spot
- **Executive Tier Management**: Improve cost-to-serve ratio
- **Bespoke Services**: New revenue stream for networking-only members

### **ERCOT Voting Optimization** 
- **Quantity Strategy**: Many small miners = more votes than few large miners
- **Retention Priority**: Small miners (1-50 MW) for vote durability
- **Large Miner Risk**: AI transition threatens both revenue and votes

## Data Gaps Identified

### **Critical for TBC**
- [ ] Actual member count by tier (vs estimates)
- [ ] Revenue breakdown by tier (confirm 3% startup figure)
- [ ] Member support request patterns (validate "asks for a lot" claims)
- [ ] MW capacity by member (for ERCOT voting calculation)
- [ ] Member acquisition costs by source/tier
- [ ] Event revenue vs dues revenue split

### **Competitive Intelligence Needed**
- [ ] Known dual memberships (BMC, Blockchain Association, etc.)
- [ ] Member feedback on TBC vs competitor value props
- [ ] Recent member losses and stated reasons

## Next Analysis: ERCOT Voting Power Model

**Focus**: Quantify current voting position, model scenarios, assess Data Center Coalition threat
