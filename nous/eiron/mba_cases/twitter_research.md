## 4. Musk's Strategy Results

### What Worked

**Valuation Recovery:**

**Subscription Model Innovation:**

- Creator monetization through ad revenue sharing
- Expanded verification system (though controversial)

### What Failed

**Advertising Business:**

- Top 5 advertisers spent <$3.3M in 2024 vs significantly higher pre-acquisition

**Subscription Uptake:**

- High churn: Over half of early subscribers discontinued service
- Revenue contribution remains minimal vs advertising losses

**Content Moderation Issues:**
- Advertiser concerns over brand safety persist
- Policy changes created uncertainty for major brands
- Legal threats to force advertiser return damaged relationships

### Mixed Results

**API Monetization:**
- Eliminated free API access (February 2023)

- Some revenue generation but ecosystem damage

**Platform Changes:**
