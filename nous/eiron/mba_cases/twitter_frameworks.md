## 1. Rumelt's "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy" Framework

### What Made Twitter's Original Strategy "Bad"?

According to Rumelt's framework, bad strategies suffer from four key defects:

#### **Fluff and Meaningless Concepts**
- Twitter's mission of "serving the public conversation" was vague and unmeasurable
- No clear definition of success metrics or target outcomes
- Generic statements about "connecting people" without specificity

#### **Failure to Face the Challenge**
- Twitter never adequately addressed the fundamental monetization challenge
- Ignored the moderation/content quality problem for years
- Failed to tackle user growth stagnation (stuck at ~200M daily users)

#### **Mistaking Goals for Strategy**
- "Increase daily active users" was a goal, not a strategy
- "Be the town square of the internet" was aspirational, not actionable
- No coherent theory of how to achieve stated objectives

#### **Bad Strategic Objectives**
- Objectives that were unrealistic (compete with Facebook's scale)
- Conflicting goals (free speech vs. brand safety for advertisers)
- No prioritization among multiple competing objectives

### What Would a "Good" Strategy Look Like?

Using Rumelt's **Kernel of Strategy**:

#### **1. Diagnosis**
*The Challenge:* Twitter faces a fundamental business model mismatch. Its real-time, public conversation format creates high engagement but also high toxicity, making it valuable to power users but challenging for mainstream adoption and advertiser comfort.

#### **2. Guiding Policy**
*The Approach:* Position Twitter as the premium real-time information and professional discourse platform, serving a smaller but highly engaged and influential user base willing to pay for quality.

#### **3. Coherent Actions**
- **Subscription Focus**: Transition from ad-dependent to subscription-primary revenue
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Implement robust verification and reputation systems
- **Professional Positioning**: Target journalists, analysts, executives, and thought leaders
- **Real-time Advantage**: Double down on breaking news and live event coverage
- **API Monetization**: Charge for data access that powers other platforms

## 2. Two-Sided Platform Analysis

### Platform Structure
Twitter operates as a **two-sided platform** connecting:
- **Side A**: Content creators (users posting tweets)
- **Side B**: Content consumers (users reading/engaging) + Advertisers

### Network Effects Dynamics

#### **Direct Network Effects**
- **User-to-User**: More users → more content → higher value for all users
- **Cross-side Effects**: More users → more attractive to advertisers → more revenue for platform improvements

#### **Data Network Effects**
- More users → better recommendation algorithms → improved user experience
- More engagement data → better ad targeting → higher advertiser ROI

### The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

#### **Twitter's Historical Solution**
1. **Celebrity Seeding**: Attracted high-profile users first
2. **Media Integration**: Became essential for journalists and news organizations
3. **Real-time Events**: Positioned as the go-to platform for live commentary

#### **Current Challenges**
- Algorithm changes reduced organic reach
- Verification chaos decreased trust signals
- Competition from TikTok and other platforms

### Value Creation Analysis

#### **For Users**
- **Information Access**: Real-time news and trending topics
- **Professional Networking**: Industry connections and thought leadership
- **Entertainment**: Humor, memes, cultural commentary
- **Civic Engagement**: Political discourse and activism

#### **For Advertisers**
- **Targeting**: Access to real-time intent and interest data
- **Engagement**: Higher interaction rates during trending events
- **Brand Safety Concerns**: Public nature creates reputational risks
- **Scale Limitations**: Smaller audience than Facebook/Instagram

#### **Platform Monetization Challenges**
- **Advertiser Hesitation**: Content moderation and brand safety concerns
- **User Resistance**: Power users often opposed to heavy advertising
- **Content Quality**: Difficulty maintaining quality at scale

## 3. Porter's Five Forces Analysis

### 1. Threat of New Entrants: **MODERATE to HIGH**

#### **Barriers to Entry**
- **Low Technical Barriers**: Social media platforms relatively easy to build

- **Network Effects**: Existing user bases create switching costs

#### **Recent Entrants**
- **TikTok**: Captured younger demographics with algorithmic feeds
- **Truth Social**: Targeted conservative users
- **Mastodon/Bluesky**: Decentralized alternatives gained traction
- **Threads**: Meta's direct Twitter competitor

### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: **LOW**

#### **Key Suppliers**
- **Content Creators**: Individual users providing content
- **Technology Infrastructure**: Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud)
- **Content Moderators**: Third-party moderation services

#### **Power Assessment**
- Individual users have little bargaining power
- High-profile users have more influence but are replaceable
- Infrastructure providers are commoditized

### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: **HIGH**

#### **User Power**
- **Zero Switching Costs**: Easy to move to competitors
- **Platform Alternatives**: Multiple options available
- **Network Effects Work Both Ways**: Users can collectively leave

#### **Advertiser Power**
- **Budget Alternatives**: Can shift spending to Facebook, Google, TikTok
- **Brand Safety Concerns**: Can boycott over content issues
- **ROI Requirements**: Demand measurable returns

### 4. Threat of Substitutes: **HIGH**

#### **Direct Substitutes**
- **Meta Platforms**: Facebook, Instagram, Threads
- **TikTok**: Short-form video content
- **LinkedIn**: Professional networking
- **Discord**: Community-based conversations

#### **Indirect Substitutes**
- **Traditional Media**: TV, newspapers, radio
- **Newsletter Platforms**: Substack, Medium
- **Messaging Apps**: WhatsApp, Telegram
- **Gaming Platforms**: Twitch, Discord

### 5. Competitive Rivalry: **INTENSE**

#### **Factors Intensifying Competition**
- **Slow Market Growth**: Social media user growth plateauing
- **High Exit Barriers**: Significant sunk costs in platform development
- **Product Differentiation Challenges**: Features easily copied
- **Strategic Stakes**: Platform control means data and attention control

#### **Key Competitors**
- **Meta**: Dominant in social networking
- **TikTok**: Leading in engagement time
