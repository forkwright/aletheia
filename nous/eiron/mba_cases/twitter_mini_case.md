## Case Overview

In late 2021, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder, was ousted as CEO for the second time. Dorsey had led Twitter from its founding in 2006 until 2008, and then returned as CEO for a second stint from 2015 until 2021. Despite its prominent role in public discourse, Twitter has failed to live up to expectations. In comparing normalized stock appreciation between Twitter's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013 and 2022, we see that Twitter's market cap increased by a mere 25%. Over the same period, the market cap of Meta (formerly Facebook) increased by over 620%. What went wrong? Despite churning through five CEOs in its short history, Twitter did not have a strategy!

## Three Critical Elements of Good Strategy

The case applies the framework: *diagnose the competitive challenge, formulate a guiding policy, and implement a coherent set of actions.*

### 1. DIAGNOSIS OF THE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE

Twitter is a **two-sided platform business**, matching users with advertisers. Twitter's goal is to grow its user base and foster engagement. Capturing a large number of users and their attention allows Twitter to develop fine-grained profiles for each user, which in turn allows it to sell targeted advertising matched to each user's unique profile.

**Key Challenge:** Gaining market share in the digital ad space is critical for Twitter to drive future revenue growth, which is needed to fund continued innovation in product features and services.

**Market Context (2022):**
- Global digital ad spending: $525 billion
- Twitter daily users: 210 million
- Facebook daily users: 2 billion

**Competitive Position:**
- Given Twitter's much smaller user base, advertisers view it as a **niche application**
- Advertisers channel bulk of digital ad dollars to three dominant platforms:
  - Facebook (Meta Platforms)
  - Google (Alphabet)
  - Amazon
- These platforms feed AI algorithms with user location, browsing history, demographic information for precisely targeted ads

**COVID-19 Impact:**
- Twitter lost out on the digital ad bonanza during the pandemic
- Advertisers poured billions into digital to reach stay-at-home consumers
- Twitter fell further behind digital ad giants AND younger competitors (Snap, TikTok)
- Newer entrants doubled their digital revenue during the pandemic

### 2. A GUIDING POLICY

Twitter's guiding policy is **"to have the largest audience in the world"** — which is NOT a good strategy. Indeed, it is no strategy at all. Instead, it is a **mere statement of desire**.

**Strategic Confusion:**
- As Twitter attempts to attract more users, it encounters trade-offs that are hard, perhaps even impossible, to reconcile
- Core users' needs differ from those of casual visitors or passive viewers
- To narrow these gaps, Twitter has attempted to be everything to everybody, resulting in **strategic confusion**

**Consequences:**
- Increased frustration among managers and engineers
- Turnover of key personnel
- Low employee morale
- Inferior products and services
- Competitive disadvantage

**Leadership Issues:**
- Internal turmoil was further stoked by Jack Dorsey's personnel decisions
- Promoting close personal friends into important positions

### 3. LEADERSHIP TRANSITION: GOODBYE @Jack, HELLO @paraga

**The Dorsey Problem:**
- Twitter's culture has been shaped by infighting and its leaders' public intrigues
- Insiders and analysts charged that Jack Dorsey was "missing in action" as CEO
- He focused on his fintech company Square (now Block) and spent little time on Twitter
- He announced shortly before COVID-19 that he would move to Africa

**Elliott Management Intervention:**
- Activist investor took 9% stake in the company
- Threatened proxy fight at shareholder meeting
- Presented board with list of demands, including Dorsey giving up CEO role

**Parag Agrawal Appointed (November 2021):**
- Formerly Twitter's Chief Technology Officer
- Native of India, computer engineer and scientist
- Graduated from IIT, holds master's and doctoral degrees from Stanford

**Agrawal's Strategic Initiatives:**
1. Shut down custom-built technology infrastructure (had security, reliability, scaling issues)
2. Moved back-end computing to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
3. Fine-tuned Twitter's ad platform for higher accuracy targeting

*Note: Jack Dorsey himself had called Twitter "slow" and "not innovative"*

### 4. CORE PRODUCT CHALLENGE

**Text vs. Visual:**
- Twitter is a text-based SMS service
- Newer competitors (Instagram, TikTok) are photo and video based
- The vast majority of people are visual and not textual
- Pictures and videos allow users to relax, facilitate online shopping
- Twitter is the forum where news breaks, is shaped, and is battled over
- Twitter is, by its nature, combative
- New services will find it hard to dislodge Twitter from this niche

**Revenue Opportunity:**
- Apply AI to Twitter's vast amount of real-time information
- License data insights to: stockbrokers, investment banks, hedge funds, media companies, Fortune 500 companies, governments
- In 2021, revenues from licensing data to enterprise customers were less than 15% of Twitter's revenues
- Room for growth exists

### 5. THE MUSK ACQUISITION

**Timeline:**
- March 2021: Twitter market cap peak at $62 billion
- Early 2022: Market cap declined to $29 billion (loss of more than 50%)
- Spring 2022: Elon Musk revealed 9% stake, becoming single largest shareholder

**Musk's Concerns:**
- Twitter's commitment to free speech
- Tweeted to 100M+ followers: "Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"
- Follow-up: "The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully."
- Result: More than 70% voted no

**The Deal:**
- Musk made offer to buy Twitter for $44 billion, taking company private
- Summer 2022: Musk announced he would walk away (citing fake accounts/bots data issues)
- Twitter sued Musk to fulfill commitment
- Fall 2022: Acquisition closed, Twitter became private company

**Musk's New Strategy:**
- Less reliance on advertising
- Subscription-based model
- All human users should be verified
- Bots, spam, and scams removed more aggressively
- Less content moderation
- "Free speech as the bedrock of a functioning democracy"
- "Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated"

**First Actions:**
- Fired a slew of senior executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal
