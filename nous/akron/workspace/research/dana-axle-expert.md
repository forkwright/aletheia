## 3.54 Gear Ratio Analysis

### Highway Performance (5.9L 12-Valve Cummins + 46RE)
**Transmission Ratios (46RE):**
- 1st: 2.74:1
- 2nd: 1.54:1
- 3rd: 1.00:1
- Overdrive: 0.69:1

**Calculated RPM with 245/75R16 tires (29.47" diameter):**

| Speed (mph) | Engine RPM | Load Condition | Notes |
|-------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| 55 | ~1,530 | Light cruise | Optimal efficiency range |
| 60 | ~1,670 | Highway cruise | Good fuel economy |
| 65 | ~1,810 | Highway speed | Normal cruise |
| 70 | ~1,950 | High cruise | Approaching power band |
| 75 | ~2,090 | Upper cruise | Near torque peak |
| 80 | ~2,230 | High speed | Above optimal efficiency |

**Note:** 12-valve Cummins torque peak ~1,600-2,000 RPM makes 3.54 gears well-suited for highway driving.

### Towing Considerations
**Pros:**
- Good highway fuel economy
- Lower engine RPM at cruise speeds
- Suitable for light to moderate towing

**Cons:**
- Limited low-end torque multiplication
- May struggle with heavy loads on grades
- Potential for transmission hunting under load

### Tire Size Upgrade Path
If upgrading to larger tires, gear ratio change recommendations:

| Tire Size | Diameter | Recommended Gear | Effect |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Stock 245/75R16 | 29.47" | 3.54 (current) | Baseline |
| 285/75R16 | 32.83" | 4.10 | Restore performance |
| 33x12.50R16 | 33.0" | 4.10-4.56 | Maintain drivability |
| 35x12.50R17 | 35.0" | 4.56 | Aggressive towing setup |

### Speedometer Calibration
- 3.54 gears are electronically controlled via PCM
- Tire size changes require speedometer recalibration
- Can be adjusted through PCM programming or gear ratio change
