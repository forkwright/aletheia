  - Per DieselHub and Cummins Forum sources
  - Matches documented capacity in vehicle records
- **Coolant Mix:** 50/50 ethylene glycol and distilled water
- **Pressure Cap:** Standard 13-16 PSI (exact spec TBD - needs verification)

### OEM Thermostat Specifications

## SCA (Supplemental Coolant Additive) - CRITICAL INFORMATION

### The SCA Controversy - RESOLVED
**BOTTOM LINE: The 5.9L Cummins B-series engine does NOT require SCA additives.**

### Technical Explanation
- **Engine Design:** The 5.9L Cummins uses "parent bore" cylinders (no wet sleeves)
- **No Cavitation Risk:** Unlike wet-sleeved engines (8.3L Cummins, 7.3L PowerStroke), the B-series doesn't experience cylinder wall cavitation
- **Official Position:** Cummins does NOT recommend SCA for B-series engines
- **Source Authority:** Multiple diesel forums, Cummins technical documentation

### Why the Confusion?
- **Other Engines:** Wet-sleeved diesels (8.3L Cummins, CAT, etc.) DO require SCA
- **Dealer Misinformation:** Some dealers incorrectly apply blanket "diesel needs SCA" advice
- **Old Habits:** Mechanics familiar with other diesels may incorrectly recommend SCA

### SCA Testing (If Desired)
- **Test Strips:** Fleetguard CC2602A (have finite shelf life)
- **Target Levels:** 1.5-3.0 ppm (for engines that need it)
- **SCA Product:** Fleetguard DCA4 (if somehow needed)

### Coolant Recommendations
1. **Fleetguard ES COMPLEAT ELC (CC2820):** 150,000-mile service life, blue, no SCA required
2. **Fleetguard ES COMPLEAT OAT ELC (CC36073):** 300,000-mile service life, red, no SCA required
3. **Standard Green Coolant + Distilled Water:** Acceptable with regular changes

## Water Pump Specifications

### OEM Water Pump
- **Part Numbers:**
  - **3800984** (primary OEM part number)
  - **4891252** (alternative/updated part number)
- **Construction:** Cast iron housing, 5-blade impeller
- **Mounting:** 2-hole mounting configuration

### Weep Hole Information
- **Purpose:** Indicates bearing/seal failure when coolant leaks from hole
- **Location:** Bottom of pump housing - "weep hole must be down" during installation
- **Failure Warning:** Any coolant leaking from weep hole indicates pump replacement needed
- **Orientation Critical:** Some aftermarket pumps have different weep hole positions

### Water Pump Lifespan
- **Typical Service Life:** 100,000-150,000 miles under normal conditions
- **High-Mile Considerations:** At 307,000+ miles, pump may need attention despite recent replacement
- **Replacement Complexity:** Moderate - requires belt removal, hose disconnection, alternator bracket removal

### Upgrade Options
- **FlowKooler 1792:** High-flow water pump for performance applications
- **CPP Water Pump:** OEM-equivalent replacement
- **Gates 43526:** Popular aftermarket option

### Installation Notes
- **Water Pump O-Ring:** Cummins 3906698 (always replace)
- **RTV Sealant:** Use Permatex Ultra Black around lift eye
- **Curing Time:** 24 hours before operation

## Common Problems & Failure Points

### Fan Clutch Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Engine overheats at idle/low speed but cools while driving
- Loud "screaming" fan noise, especially with A/C on
- Loss of power and fuel economy when clutch sticks engaged
- Fan freewheels constantly (doesn't engage when hot)

**Diagnosis:**
- Side-to-side play indicates bearing failure
- Fan should engage when engine is hot
- Should freewheel when engine is cold

**Replacement:**
- **Mopar 52028760:** OEM replacement (1990-1998)
- **CPP Fan Clutch:** OEM-equivalent aftermarket

### Belt & Tensioner Problems
- **Slipping Belt:** Reduces cooling efficiency for both fan and water pump
- **Automatic Tensioner Failure:** Common at high mileage
- **Oil Contamination:** Avoid silicone spray on belts/pulleys
- **Replacement Parts:** Dayco 89362 belt tensioner (OEM supplier)

### Hose Failure Points
**Common Failure Areas:**
- Upper radiator hose (1994-1998: Gates 22081)
- Lower radiator hose (1994-1998: Gates 22082)
- Heater core lines (aging rubber becomes brittle)
- Overflow tank hose connections

**Upgrade Options:**
- **Mishimoto Silicone Kit:** Multi-ply silicone construction, multiple colors
- **CPP Silicone Kit:** Direct-fit black silicone kit for 94-98

### Cavitation Issues
**NOT A CONCERN** for the 5.9L Cummins due to parent-bore design. This is a wet-sleeve engine problem that does not apply.

### Heater Core Problems
**Moisture Intrusion Noted in Vehicle Records:**
- Previous passenger-side floor wetness (since resolved)
- Could indicate heater core beginning to fail
- Early warning: sweet coolant smell in cabin
- **Heater Core Lines:** Consider Fleece FPE-CUMM-SSHCL-12V upgrade kit

## Cooling System Bleeding Procedure

### Critical Steps
1. **Locate Bleed Screw:** Thread bolt on cylinder head next to head bolts
2. **Bleed Screw Tool:** Use 1/2" drive to unscrew
3. **Fill Process:**
   - Open bleed screw during initial fill
   - Fill radiator until coolant comes out of bleed screw
   - Close bleed screw, continue filling radiator

### Proper Bleeding Sequence
1. **Initial Fill:** With bleed screw open, fill system
2. **Close Bleed Screw:** When coolant flows from bleed hole
3. **Top Off:** Continue filling radiator to capacity
4. **Hose Squeeze:** Squeeze upper radiator hose to release air pockets
5. **Warm-Up Cycle:** Run engine to operating temperature
6. **Final Top-Off:** Check level when cool, add as needed

### Advanced Options
- **Vacuum Fillers:** Most effective method for complete air removal
- **Multiple Cycles:** May require several warm/cool cycles for complete bleeding

---

## Temperature Monitoring

### Normal Operating Temperature
- **Target Range:** 180-210°F under normal conditions
- **Thermostat Opening:** 180°F
- **Concern Point:** Sustained temps above 220°F
- **Critical:** Above 240°F requires immediate shutdown

### Temperature Sensor Location
- **ECT Sensor:** Located on engine block (exact location needs documentation)
- **Gauge Sender:** May be different from ECT sensor
- **Multiple Sensors:** Engine may have separate sensors for gauge vs. ECM

### Aftermarket Gauge Considerations
- **AutoMeter Gauges:** Available (part numbers in vehicle inventory)
- **Placement:** Typically in A-pillar or dash pod
- **Accuracy:** Aftermarket gauges often more accurate than factory
- **Redundancy:** Backup monitoring recommended for towing/performance use

### When to Worry
- **Gradual Temperature Rise:** May indicate restricted airflow or failing fan clutch
- **Rapid Temperature Rise:** Could indicate coolant loss or pump failure
- **Temperature Cycling:** May indicate air in system or failing thermostat

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Overheating Diagnoses

**Overheating at Idle/Low Speed:**
- **Primary Suspect:** Fan clutch failure
- **Secondary:** Radiator restriction or air blockage
- **Test:** Feel fan engagement when engine is hot

**Overheating Under Load:**
- **Primary Suspect:** Restricted radiator or low coolant
- **Secondary:** Water pump impeller failure
- **Test:** Pressure test system, verify coolant flow

**Gradual Temperature Increase:**
- **Likely Causes:** Scale buildup, air in system, failing thermostat
- **Action:** System flush, proper bleeding, thermostat replacement

### Coolant Loss Diagnoses

**External Leaks:**
- Water pump weep hole (bearing failure)
- Hose connections (age-related failure)
- Radiator tanks (plastic fatigue)
- Overflow tank cracks

**Internal Leaks:**
- Head gasket (rare on Cummins)
- Heater core (sweet smell in cabin)
- Transmission cooler (ATF in coolant)

### Temperature Gauge Issues

**Gauge Reads Cold:**
- Failed temperature sender
- Wiring problem to gauge
- Bad gauge (rare)

**Gauge Reads Hot:**
- Verify actual temperature with infrared thermometer
