# Akron — Complete Build Vision

**1997 Dodge Ram 2500 4x4 Club Cab SLT Laramie**
**VIN:** 3B7KF23D9VM592245
**Mileage:** ~307,500
**Build Philosophy:** The last mechanical truck

---

## The Vision

This is not a restoration. This is not a project truck. This is the truck that should still be available new but isn't.

**Final Form:**
- 12-valve Cummins (P7100 mechanical injection)
- NV5600 6-speed manual transmission
- 4.56 gears
- 35" tires
- Dana 60/70-2U axles

**Why This Configuration:**
- No ECM. No DEF. No DPF. No EGR.
- Mechanical fuel injection (tunable with a screwdriver)
- Manual transmission (direct mechanical connection)
- Optimal gearing for tire size and highway RPM
- Rebuildable indefinitely with hand tools

## The Philosophy

### What This Truck IS
- **Anti-fragile infrastructure** — works when everything else fails
- **Mechanically simple** — no computers, no software, no subscriptions
- **Infinitely serviceable** — rebuildable with hand tools
- **Fuel flexible** — runs on diesel, heating oil, WVO, jet fuel
- **Self-sufficient** — full power/communications/navigation independent of infrastructure

### What This Truck IS NOT
- Fast (0-60 doesn't matter)
- Quiet (it's a diesel work truck)
- Fuel efficient (but diesel stores longer and stretches further)
- Modern (no backup camera, no lane assist, no bullshit)
- Dependent on anyone or anything

### The Build Arc
| Phase | What Changes | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Now | Steering, maintenance | Roadworthy |
| 3mo | P7100 mods, gauges | ~280 HP, monitored |
| 6mo | Alternator, aux power | Full capability |
| 12mo | Driveline, track bar | Reliability |
| **24mo** | **NV5600, 4.56, 35s** | **Final form** |

After Phase 5, the drivetrain is done. Forever.

---

## Use Case

**Primary:**
- Reliable work truck
- Towing (gooseneck + conventional)
- Daily driver capable
- 20+ year ownership horizon

**Secondary:**
- Overland/adventure platform
- Teardrop trailer towing
- Emergency/disaster capable
- Self-sufficient operations

**The Goal:**
A truck that starts every time, pulls whatever you hook to it, goes where you point it, and can be fixed with what's in the toolbox.

---

## Critical Blockers

| Blocker | Blocks | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Alternator (136A → 370A) | Aux electrical system | $1,229 Mechman kit |
| Steering box frame bolt torque | Weekend install | Call RedHead |

## Known Issues — Investigation Notes

### 10A Illumination Fuse Short
**Symptom:** Fuse blows instantly when headlight switch engaged
**Photo Evidence Found:**
- Poor aftermarket wiring behind dash — blue butt connectors, loose bundles, DIY splices
- Fuse panel heat discoloration around positions 3-4
- Multiple non-OEM splices with yellow connectors and electrical tape

**Likely Cause:** Aftermarket lights or trailer controller wiring by previous owner
**Action:** Inspect wiring behind dash during dashboard installation

### Brake Light Switch
**Photo Evidence:** Heavily corroded
**Action:** Replace during steering/dash work for safety

### Structural Condition
**Confirmed Good:**
- Floor pan solid — no rust-through
- Treated during sound deadening project
- Surface rust on suspension typical for age

## Plan Validation (2026-02-03)

All planned items reviewed against build philosophy. Key decisions confirmed:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **370A Alternator** | Future expansion: 200Ah+ battery bank, potential solar |
| **4.56 Gears** | "Oomph" matters for lifetime ownership; ~$250/yr fuel acceptable |
| **Acoustic Glass** | Trigger on windshield replacement; do with ceramic tint |
| **NV5600** | Final form, not contingency; defer install until 46RE tested at 280HP |
| **CAT Filter** | Alt fuels capability (WVO, biodiesel, heating oil) |

**Ownership Philosophy:** "Either I die or the truck dies." This is a lifetime partnership, not a monetary investment. All decisions evaluated against 20-30 year horizon.
