## ⚠️ CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION

**This truck has a 46RE transmission, NOT a 47RE.**

Many online resources incorrectly conflate the 46RE and 47RE, but they are distinctly different transmissions with different specifications, capabilities, and parts.

---

## 1. 46RE Identification & Specifications

### Physical Identification
- **Transmission Case:** Aluminum construction with integrated bellhousing
- **Pan Shape:** Deep sump rectangular pan with front corner cut-out
- **Tag Location:** Located on driver's side of transmission case
- **Part Number Format:** P46RE (Chrysler designation)
- **Cooler Lines:** Two lines - supply and return

### Key Specifications
| Specification | 46RE | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| **Gear Ratios** | 1st: 2.74:1, 2nd: 1.54:1, 3rd: 1.00:1, OD: 0.69:1, Rev: 2.20:1 | Standard ratios |
| **Torque Capacity** | ~350 ft-lbs stock | Conservative rating |
| **Fluid Capacity** | **14.5 qts total** | *Documented - needs verification* |
| **Service Fill** | ~12 qts | During fluid change |
| **Fluid Type** | **ATF+4** | *Documented - verify current spec* |
| **Filter** | 4x4 Deep Pan Filter | Different from 2WD |
| **Weight** | ~180 lbs | Approximate |

### Governor Pressure Solenoid System
**This truck has an HD Borgeson governor pressure solenoid kit installed.**

**Background:**
The 46RE originally uses a mechanical governor system that can be inconsistent, especially behind diesel engines. The governor controls when the transmission shifts by creating hydraulic pressure proportional to vehicle speed.

**HD Governor Solenoid Kit Benefits:**
- **Electronic Control:** Replaces mechanical governor weights with electronic solenoid
- **Consistent Shifts:** Eliminates wear-related shift inconsistencies
- **Diesel Optimization:** Better suited for diesel torque characteristics
- **Programmable:** Some systems allow shift point adjustment
- **Reliability:** Fewer mechanical parts to wear out
- **Load Adaptation:** Better response under varying load conditions

**How It Works:**
1. Vehicle speed sensor input replaces mechanical governor
2. Electronic module calculates required governor pressure
3. Solenoid provides precise pressure control
4. Results in more consistent, firmer shifts

**Compatibility with ETB Pump:**
- Helps manage the electronic pump's consistent power delivery
- Provides better shift timing for diesel's narrow power band
- Important for maintaining transmission longevity with diesel torque

## 2. 46RE vs 47RE Differences

### Critical Distinctions

| Component | 46RE | 47RE |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Duty Rating** | Light-Medium Duty | Heavy Duty |
| **Torque Capacity** | ~350 ft-lbs | ~450+ ft-lbs |
| **Input Shaft** | Smaller diameter | Larger, stronger |
| **Case Strength** | Standard aluminum | Reinforced aluminum |
| **Clutch Packs** | Thinner clutches | Thicker, more clutches |
| **Pump** | Standard pressure | Higher pressure capacity |
| **Applications** | Light trucks, SUVs | Heavy trucks, commercial |

### Physical Differences
- **Input Shaft:** 47RE has a larger diameter input shaft with more splines
- **Case Ribbing:** 47RE has additional reinforcement ribs
- **Valve Body:** Different hydraulic circuits and pressure settings
- **Cooler Fittings:** 47RE may have larger or additional fittings

### Parts Interchangeability
- **NOT Interchangeable:** Input shafts, torque converters, valve bodies

## 16. Conclusion

The 46RE transmission in your 1997 Ram 2500 is at a critical point with 307k miles. The HD Borgeson governor solenoid kit was an excellent upgrade that should help extend transmission life, especially with the ETB pump's characteristics.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Vigilant Monitoring:** Watch fluid condition and temperature
2. **Preventive Maintenance:** Frequent fluid changes are critical
3. **Load Management:** Respect the transmission's limits
4. **Early Intervention:** Address problems before they become failures

**Power Recommendations:**
- Stock power levels are appropriate for this transmission age
- Any power increases should be accompanied by transmission upgrades
- The HD governor kit helps but doesn't increase power capacity
