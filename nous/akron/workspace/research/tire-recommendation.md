# Tire Recommendation — 35" for Akron

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Requirement:** "The very best" — capable off-road, good highway, extremely unlikely to go flat

---

## The Answer: Goodyear Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar

**Size:** 35x12.50R17 Load Range E

**Why:**
- **Kevlar-reinforced sidewalls** — actual Kevlar, not marketing
- **3-ply polyester + 2 steel belt construction** — maximum puncture resistance
- **Wraparound tread** — protects sidewall from rock cuts
- **Proven** — military vehicle choice, oilfield/mining standard

**Trade-offs:**
- Louder than all-terrains (this is a mud-terrain)
- Shorter tread life (~40K vs 50K+ for KO2)
- Slightly worse wet braking than pure highway tires
- Price premium (~$400-450/tire)

**Cost (5 tires):** ~$2,000-2,250

## Alternative: BFG KO2 (If You Want Better Road Manners)

**Size:** 35x12.50R17 Load Range E

**Why:**
- **CoreGard sidewall** — excellent puncture resistance for an A/T
- **Quieter** than MT/R on highway
- **Longer tread life** — 50K+ miles
- **3PMSF rated** — excellent snow performance

**Trade-off:**
- Not as puncture-resistant as Kevlar-reinforced MT/R
- Less aggressive in mud/rocks

**Cost (5 tires):** ~$1,400-1,600

## Recommendation

**For your use case (towing, overland, daily, "never go flat"):**

**Primary: Goodyear Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar**

This is "the very best" for puncture resistance. Period. Military trusts it, oilfield trusts it. The Kevlar sidewalls are legitimately different — not just marketing. Yes, it's louder. Yes, it costs more. But you asked for "extremely unlikely to go flat" and this is the answer.

**Alternative: BFG KO2** if highway comfort matters more than absolute puncture resistance.

## Pairing with Gears

**Do together:**
- 35" tires + 4.56 gears in same shop visit
- One alignment, one calibration
- Leave with finished drivetrain

**Cost:**

- 4.56 gears + install: ~$2,500-3,200
- **Total: ~$4,500-5,500**
