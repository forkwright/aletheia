# Track Bar Upgrade Options for 1997 Ram 2500 with 4" Front Lift

**Vehicle:** 1997 Dodge Ram 2500 "Akron"  
**Current Setup:** Thuren XS soft coils (2" lift) + PRP 2" spacers = 4" total front lift  
**Steering Box:** RedHead 2869-3T (being installed)

## Executive Summary

**Death wobble is primarily caused by track bar issues (80% of cases).** With a 4" front lift, an adjustable track bar is absolutely essential. The stock 2nd gen Ram track bar is fundamentally flawed and will cause death wobble with any significant lift due to:

- Weak geometry and flexible design
- Inadequate rubber bushings that deflect under load
- Poor mounting locations that amplify steering issues

**Top Recommendation:** Thuren 2nd Gen Track Bar ($575) - Best overall engineering and compatibility with your existing Thuren suspension components.

---

## Technical Background: Why Track Bar Matters

### The Physics of Death Wobble

Per Thuren Fabrication's engineering analysis:

> "When Death Wobble happens, even though you're holding the steering wheel firmly, the flex in a bad design track bar assembly allows the axle to shift side to side causing the tires to turn, even though the steering wheel remains stationary."

**Key Points:**
- Track bar is both a suspension AND steering component
- Any deflection in bushings or bar flex immediately affects steering
- Larger tires (33"+ on your setup) increase forces on track bar exponentially
- 4" lift puts track bar at severe angle, amplifying problems

### What Triggers Death Wobble
- Hitting bumps where one tire contacts before the other
- Railroad tracks, bridge joints, potholes at speed
- Forces put track bar under tension/compression
- Energy release causes axle shifting and oscillation

## Installation Considerations

### Compatibility with RedHead Steering Box

**Good News:** All track bar options should be compatible with the RedHead steering box since they mount to the axle and frame, not the steering box itself.

**Potential Issues:**
- None anticipated with steering box
- Track bar works independently of steering box
- Both use factory pitman arm mounting points

### Installation Requirements

**Tools Needed:**
- Basic hand tools (wrenches, sockets)
- Jack and jack stands
- Drill and bits (for some installations)
- Torque wrench
- Possibly cutting tools for sway bar clearance

**Time Required:**
- 2-4 hours depending on complexity
- Additional time if sway bar modifications needed
- Alignment recommended after installation

**Skill Level:**
- Intermediate to advanced
- Critical suspension component - professional installation recommended

### Potential Complications

**Sway Bar Clearance:**
- Thuren bar may require sway bar modifications on 1994-1997 trucks
- May need to convert to 98.5+ style sway bar mounts
- Consider removing sway bar if primarily off-road use

**Differential Cover Clearance:**
- Most track bars designed around stock diff cover
- Aftermarket diff covers may cause interference
- Check clearances before purchase

**Alignment Changes:**
- Track bar replacement will require alignment
- May affect castor and steering centering
- Professional alignment strongly recommended
