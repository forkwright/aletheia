## Installation Differences from OEM

### Sintech-Specific Considerations

#### Manufacturing Quality
- **Material:** Black plastic construction (matches OEM spec)
- **Design:** Direct OEM replacement design
- **Quality:** Aftermarket part - inspect for molding defects or rough edges
- **Warranty:** 2-year coverage (superior to many OEM replacements)

#### Installation Variations
- **Centering Procedure:** IDENTICAL to OEM (2.5 turns CCW)
- **Connector Compatibility:** DIRECT OEM replacement
- **Mounting Method:** STANDARD OEM attachment points
- **Torque Specifications:** SAME as OEM (no special requirements)

#### Potential Differences
- ⚠️ **Locking Tabs:** May differ slightly in design but function remains same
- ⚠️ **Internal Ribbon:** Aftermarket ribbon may have different tension - follow centering exactly
- ⚠️ **Wire Routing:** Verify cruise control wiring is properly terminated
- ⚠️ **Build Tolerance:** Inspect for proper fit and finish upon installation
