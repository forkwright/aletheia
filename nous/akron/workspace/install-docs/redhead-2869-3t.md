# RedHead Steering Gear 2869-3T Installation Documentation
*Research compiled: 2026-02-03*

## Vehicle Application
**RedHead Part #**: 2869-3T (3-3.5 Turns)  
**Fits**: 1994-2001 Dodge 1500 or 1994-2002 Dodge 2500-3500 Pickup Trucks  
**Your Vehicle**: 1997 Dodge Ram 2500 4x4 with 4" lift  

## Official Sources
- **Primary**: https://redheadsteeringgears.com/2869-3T
- **FAQ/Installation**: https://redheadsteeringgears.com/faq
- **Technical Support**: XDP (xtremediesel.com)
- **Community Experience**: Cummins Forum, The Diesel Stop

## Specifications
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Ratio | 15:1 (3 turns lock-to-lock) |
| Input | Small Input 25 spline |
| Output | 32 Spline Sector, 4 Master Spline |
| Weight | 29.00 lbs |
| Fittings | O-Ring |
| Warranty | 12 months (unlimited miles) |

**Note**: Gas engine trucks typically use 15:1 ratio, diesel trucks typically use 18:1 ratio. Your 5.9L Cummins may need the 2869-4T (18:1 ratio) instead - verify by counting steering wheel turns lock-to-lock.

## Critical Torque Specifications

### Pitman Arm Torque
**Per RedHead FAQ**: 185 ft-lbs (for 1993-2002 Dodge 2500/3500)
- **DO NOT use anti-seize** - splines are tapered for perfect connection
- **DO NOT hammer or press** pitman arm
- **Use torque wrench only** - NO IMPACT TOOLS
- Pitman arm should seat with some splines still exposed on sector shaft

### Frame Mounting Bolts
**Your Current Spec**: 95 ft-lbs (verified from your documentation)
**Comparison**: RedHead FAQ doesn't specify frame bolt torque - refers to "factory torque spec"
**Action Required**: Verify your 95 ft-lbs spec against Dodge service manual

## Installation Procedures

### Pre-Installation
1. **Verify Ratio**: Count turns lock-to-lock on current steering wheel
   - 3-3.5 turns = 15:1 ratio (2869-3T correct)
   - 4-4.5 turns = 18:1 ratio (need 2869-4T instead)

2. **Fluid Specification**: 
   - Use manufacturer-recommended fluid (typically Dexron 3 ATF)
   - RedHead tests with Dexron 3 ATF before shipping

### Installation Steps
1. Remove old steering box
2. Install new RedHead box with frame bolts to 95 ft-lbs (verify spec)
3. Install pitman arm - DO NOT use anti-seize
4. Torque pitman arm nut to 185 ft-lbs with torque wrench
5. Connect steering linkage
6. Fill and bleed system (see bleeding procedure below)

### Air Bleeding Procedure (CRITICAL)
**Per RedHead FAQ**:
1. Fill system with fluid
2. Raise front wheels off ground - **DO NOT START ENGINE**
3. Work steering wheel lock-to-lock 15-20 times
4. Let sit AT LEAST 2 hours (overnight best)
5. Top off reservoir
6. Work steering wheel 7-10 times more
7. Have helper at reservoir with fluid ready
8. Start engine - **immediately top off fluid as level drops**
9. Must maintain fluid level or will suck air back in

## Break-In Procedure
**Known Information**: No full lock-to-lock for 200 miles

**Research Gap**: RedHead FAQ and official sources do not specify detailed break-in procedures beyond the standard bleeding process. This may be dealer/installer knowledge or word-of-mouth practice.

**Recommended Action**: Contact RedHead directly at:
- Phone: (contact info needed)
- Address: 4302 B ST NW, Auburn, WA 98001

## Steering Box Support Brace Compatibility

### PRP EL205 Compatibility
**Status**: ✅ **COMPATIBLE**

**Forum Evidence** (Cummins Forum):
- "Any brace that works with stock should work with the red head and borg boxes"
- Multiple users confirm standard braces work with RedHead boxes
- RedHead housing is similar to OEM dimensions for mounting

**Your Setup**: PRP EL205 already installed - should work without modification

### Alternative Braces (if needed)
- **DOR (Dodge Off Road)**: Bolts to pump, acts as debris guard
- **PSC Motorsports**: Popular option
- **Big D Off Road**: Self-centering bearing design
- **Dodge Ram Steering Stabilizer** (dodgeramsteeringstabilizer.com)

## Potential Issues & Gotchas

### Installation Gotchas
1. **Pitman Arm Removal**: Most challenging part - consider purchasing new pitman arm from RedHead to avoid removal
2. **Anti-Seize**: DO NOT USE on pitman arm splines
3. **Air Bleeding**: Critical - must follow procedure exactly or steering will be poor
4. **Centering**: Box ships centered - maintain this during installation

### Break-In Considerations
1. **200-mile restriction** on full lock-to-lock (source: your knowledge - verify with RedHead)
2. **Initial settling**: Some users report needing adjustment after break-in period
3. **Fluid monitoring**: Check fluid level frequently during break-in

### Quality Concerns (Mixed Reviews)
- Some forum users report excellent results
- Others disappointed with play reduction vs. cost
- Customer service generally praised
- Quality appears variable between units

## Parts You May Need

### Essential
- **New pitman arm nut/washer** (included with RedHead)
- **Power steering fluid** (Dexron 3 ATF recommended)

### Optional but Recommended
- **New pitman arm** from RedHead (eliminates removal hassle)
- **Drop pitman arm** if 4-6" lift (you have 4" - may need this)

## Action Items Before Installation
1. **Verify gear ratio** by counting steering wheel turns
2. **Confirm break-in procedure** directly with RedHead
3. **Verify frame bolt torque spec** against Dodge service manual
4. **Consider drop pitman arm** for 4" lift
5. **Purchase Dexron 3 ATF** for fluid change

## Research Gaps
- **Detailed break-in procedure** (200-mile restriction needs verification)
- **Frame bolt torque specification** from RedHead
- **Drop pitman arm necessity** for 4" lift
- **Official installation manual/PDF** (may not exist publicly)
