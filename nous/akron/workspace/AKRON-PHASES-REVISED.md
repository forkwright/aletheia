## Summary

| Phase | Focus | Spend | Labor |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | Get driving | ~$300 | You |
| **2** | Install what you own + reliability | ~$1,100 | You |
| **3** | Critical upgrades + BIFL mods | ~$4,250 | You/Shop |
| **4** | 4WD/driveline | ~$1,400 | You |
| **5** | Regear + NV5600 | ~$8,000-12,000 | **Pro** |
| **6** | Bed config + protection | ~$9,000-12,000 | Mix |

**Total new spend through Phase 4:** ~$7,050
**Phase 5 (pro work):** ~$8,000-12,000
**Phase 6 (bed + protection):** ~$9,000-12,000

---

## The Logic

1. **Phase 1-2:** Almost zero spend — you're installing $8,000+ in parts you already own
2. **Phase 3:** Targeted spend on blockers (alternator enables aux power)
3. **Phase 4:** Modest spend on driveline reliability
4. **Phase 5:** Save up, pay pros for what requires it (gears, trans)
5. **Phase 6:** As budget and priorities dictate

**You don't need to buy much for the next 6 months.** You need to *install* what's already in boxes.
