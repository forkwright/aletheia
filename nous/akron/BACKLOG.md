# Akron — Backlog (Someday/Maybe)

## Electrical
- **Complete electrical system redesign** — Not just a harness replacement. Full redesign: map every circuit by component/voltage/amperage, Deutsch DT/DTM connectors (mil-spec, waterproof), marine tinned copper wire sized per circuit, modern ATC/ATO fuse block or PDM, star ground topology. Unify all three electrical systems (factory, PowerSwitch, house) into one coherent design built from scratch. Build on bench, swap in a weekend. Current harness has: melted cigarette lighter grounds, OBD-II power taps, blue butt connector splices, aftermarket electrical tape repairs, RC light hacks (removed), and 29 years of unknown history. Can be designed as a side project while current harness runs. *(Added 2026-02-07)*
