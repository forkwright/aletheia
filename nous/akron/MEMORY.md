# Akron — Curated Memory

## Critical Corrections

### Fuse Problem (Corrected 2026-02-06)
- **WRONG:** "10A illumination fuse blows" — this was documented incorrectly across multiple sessions
- **RIGHT:** Fuse #18 PARK LAMP (15A) blows instantly. Fuse #13 ILLUM (5A) is fine.
- Dead short in park lamp circuit DOWNSTREAM of headlight switch — body/exterior wiring
- Even 20A fuse blows instantly = hard short to ground
- Most likely: tail light socket, trailer connector, license plate light, or chafed wire in rear harness

### Pitman Arm Torque (Corrected 2026-02-03)
- **WRONG:** 225 ft-lbs
- **RIGHT:** 185 ft-lbs (RedHead chart, confirmed Cummins Forum FSM refs)

## Vehicle Quick Facts
- Battery: NAPA 810 CCA, RC 140, Serial 12000134, flooded lead-acid, 14mm nut
- Fuse box part: 55055699
- SRS completely removed — pull fuses #12 and #16
- Steering: Column stays, Borgeson 000950 = intermediate shaft only

## Wiring Standards
- Factory circuits: keep factory ground locations, don't consolidate
- New circuits: ABYC E-11 marine standard, star ground, tinned copper
- Blue butt connectors on radio wiring (Cody's work) need redo with solder + heat shrink

## Grounding
- Factory dash grounds stay at factory locations with star washers
- Clean to bare metal, dielectric grease AROUND (not between) contact faces
- Star ground topology for aux power system only (Phase 3)
