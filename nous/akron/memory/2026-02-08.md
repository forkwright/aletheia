# Akron Session — 2026-02-08 / 2026-02-09 Morning

## Summary
Late evening Feb 8 session focused on brake system deep dive and finalizing the BIFL build spec, then starter diagnosis when Cody tried to start the truck. Feb 9 morning continued starter diagnosis with jump test confirming starter is good, and FSM research identifying the likely cause as a dead Neutral Safety Switch.

## Brake System — ἌΚΡΟΝ Build CONFIRMED

### Decision: Full Tier 3 No-Compromise Build (~$4,815)
Cody reviewed the three-tier brake presentation and chose Tier 3: "the BIFL, no cut corners, just great at everything build."

### Components Confirmed
| Component | PN | Price | Source |
|-----------|-----|-------|--------|
| Hydroboost conversion kit | 3083-2772-435 | ~$1,877 | Pure Diesel Power / Circle Track Supply |
| EGR rear disc w/ parking brake | EGR4601-X1 | ~$1,268 | Circle Track Supply |
| Hawk Talon front rotors (drilled/slotted) | App-specific | ~$250 | Diesel Power Products |
| Hawk HPS front pads | App-specific | ~$80 | Diesel Power Products |
| Raybestos front calipers ×2 | App-specific | ~$200 | RockAuto |
| Front stainless flex hoses ×2 | App-specific | ~$80 | EGR/Stopflex |
| Timken front wheel bearings ×2 | App-specific | ~$150 | RockAuto |
| EGR large bore master cylinder | 1-5/16" bore | ~$250 | Circle Track Supply |
| Inline Tube stainless hard line kit | SDTB9442 | ~$300 | Inline Tube |
| Wilwood adjustable prop valve | 260-8419 | ~$50 | Summit Racing |
| Motul RBF 600 brake fluid | — | ~$50 | — |
| Dorman brake switch bumper | 76942 | ~$3 | — |
| Misc hardware | — | ~$100 | — |

### System Changes
- Vacuum booster → hydroboost (PS pump powered, 1,200-2,000 PSI)
- Rear drums → disc (EGR bolt-on with integrated parking brake)
- Stock master → EGR large bore 1-5/16" (sized for disc/disc + hydroboost)
- Factory steel hard lines → full stainless pre-bent replacement
- DOT 3 → Motul RBF 600 (594°F dry)
- Add Wilwood adjustable proportioning valve

### Future Enhancement
- Ford Super Duty front knuckle swap when axles apart for 4.56 gears
- Twin-piston calipers, 13"+ rotors
- Needs ball joint compatibility research (conflicting forum info)

### Verification Needed Before Ordering
- Dana 70 vs 80 compatibility for EGR kit
- ABS tone ring compatibility with disc conversion
- Parking brake cable length for Club Cab
- PS pump flow rate supports hydroboost + steering box
- Inline Tube hard line config (4WD, 4-wheel ABS, Club Cab, long bed)

### Documentation Updated
- 04_active-projects.md: Full PROJECT 3 added with parts, phases, system interactions, verification checklist
- MEMORY.md: Brake build decision documented
- 07_torque-specifications.md: Updated brake section for new components, fluid changed to Motul RBF 600
- Build phases: Brake overhaul added to Phase 3 Critical Upgrades

## Starter Diagnosis

### Feb 8 Evening
- Cody tried to start: single click, nothing else
- **Discovery: NOCO was charging battery itself, not connected to truck terminals** — truck had only one battery in circuit
- Reconnected both batteries, both read ~13V on Simpson 260-8P
- Cleaned all battery terminals — still just light click
- Identified click as coming from PDC/relay area, NOT starter solenoid
- Swapped starter relay with fuel system relay — no change
- Tap test on starter — no change
- Purchased 1x Dorman 30A relay ($16) at local store
- Store didn't have: Dorman 76942, ATF+4, contact cleaner, dielectric grease

### Feb 9 Morning
- New relay in starter slot — no change
- **JUMP TEST: Bridged starter solenoid terminals with screwdriver — STARTER CRANKED FINE**
  - Screwdriver got arc marks from 300A (should have warned about spark intensity)
  - Confirms: starter motor ✓, solenoid ✓, batteries ✓, cables ✓, grounds ✓
  - Problem is 100% in the control circuit
- **Simpson test on relay socket (relay removed):**
  - Found constant 12V on one pin (battery feed) ✓
  - NO 12V on any pin when key held at START ✗
  - START signal never reaches the PDC relay

### FSM Research — Starting Circuit
From service manual (Operation CHARM HTML):
- **Circuit A41**: Ignition switch START position → 12V to relay coil (power side)
- **Circuit T41**: Park/Neutral Position Switch → ground path for relay coil
- **NSS is a GROUND-SIDE switch** — relay coil needs BOTH A41 power AND T41 ground
- High-impedance Simpson may not read voltage on coil pin without ground path through NSS
- This explains why no voltage was measured — the coil pin A41 may have voltage but meter can't read it without the T41 ground completing the circuit

### Most Likely Cause: Dead NSS
- Park/Neutral Position Switch on 46RE transmission, driver side near shift linkage
- Common failure on 2nd gen Rams
- ~$25 part, 20 minute swap

### Next Step
- Unplug NSS connector on driver side of 46RE
- Jumper harness-side T41 pin to ground (transmission case)
- Put relay back in, try key
- If it cranks → NSS confirmed dead, order replacement

### Workaround Available
- Turn key to RUN (powers FSS, gauges, etc.)
- Jump starter from underneath with screwdriver
- Engine will start and run
- Can do all steering work today using this method

## Steering Prep
- Full tool list provided for Phase 2 mechanical work
- Three sizes to verify: pitman arm nut hex, Borgeson shaft pinch bolt, PS hose flare nuts
- PS pump swap: 1-2 hours, needs pulley puller/installer (loaner tool)
- ATF+4 needed for bleeding — not purchased yet
- PS fluid dripping from cut hoses is expected/harmless
- All mechanical steering work can proceed without engine running
- Bleeding requires engine running (use screwdriver-jump workaround if needed)

---

## Corrections
- Faint click likely ignition switch key cylinder mechanical detent, not relay clicking
- NOCO "charged" didn't mean truck batteries were connected — clamps were on battery posts, not terminal cables
- Should warn more about arc intensity when jumping high-current solenoid circuits
