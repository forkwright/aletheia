# Akron Session — 2026-02-09

## Summary
Full steering system install day. Ignition circuit fixed (loose connector), old steering box + shaft + PS pump removed. New Borgeson PS pump install in progress. Multiple parts ordered from Amazon arriving tonight. Precision Instruments BIFL torque wrench ordered for Sunday.

---

## Ignition / Start Circuit — FIXED
- **Root cause: loose ignition switch connector on the steering column**
- Cody reconnected it and the truck cranks with the key
- Engine fires but won't hold idle — likely air in fuel lines from sitting, or FSS not getting clean 12V in RUN. Deferred.
- Workaround still available: key to RUN + jump starter with screwdriver
- The NSS bypass test (planned from Feb 8 diagnosis) was never needed — it was the ignition switch connector all along

## FSM Research — Starting & Steering Circuits
- Circuit A41: ignition switch START → 12V to relay coil
- Circuit T41: Park/Neutral Position Switch (NSS) → ground path for relay coil
- NSS is a ground-side switch on the 46RE
- PS pump on 12v Cummins: belt drives vacuum pump, vacuum pump drives PS pump internally via spline coupling

## Old Components Removed
- Old steering box (Mopar 52037653) — removed, on driveway, scrap
- Old intermediate shaft — removed, cut seized 1/2" pinch bolt with Dremel
- Old PS pump — separated from vacuum pump, 4 studs removed (one required WD-40 soak + double-nut method)
- All 3 hoses to pump assembly cut: PS pressure (hard), PS return (soft), vacuum line (soft)

## Access Removal Log (reverse to reassemble)
| # | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Driver battery | Removed from tray |
| 2 | Battery ground point | Disconnected |
| 3 | Upper radiator hose | Removed at radiator end only |
| 4 | Dual battery connector cable | Removed |
| 5 | Washer fluid reservoir | Out (1 bolt + electrical connector + rubber hose) |
| 6 | Old intermediate shaft | Out (cut pinch bolt) |
| 7 | Intercooler boot/pipe | Out (2 T-bolt clamps, twisted off seized rubber boots) |
| 8 | PS pump studs ×4 | Out (15mm, one required double-nut extraction) |
| 9 | All 3 pump hoses | Cut |
| 10 | Old PS pump | Separated from vacuum pump |

## Key Corrections
- **PS pump swap does NOT need pulley puller** on 12v Cummins. Pulley is on vacuum pump shaft, not PS pump. No transfer needed. The Orion Motor Tech puller kit ordered is good to have but not needed for this job.
- **No need to remove vacuum pump from engine block.** I overcomplicated this — Cody correctly identified the simpler path. Vacuum pump stays mounted, new PS pump slides directly onto it.
- **Vacuum pump seal kit (4089742) NOT needed for this job.** Only needed if removing vacuum pump from block. Good shelf stock for future.
- **PS pump has 3 hose connections, not 2.** FSM step 1 says "Remove and cap steering pump hoses AND vacuum pump vacuum line." That's 2 PS hoses + 1 vacuum line, all removed in the same step. I told Cody to cut all 3 without identifying them — the vacuum line didn't need to be cut.
- **Vacuum line (Mopar 04874538)** connects vacuum pump to brake booster/HVAC. No aftermarket replacement exists. Now requires brass barb splice to reconnect (Brintek kit arriving overnight).
- **The 2 small studs with holes on the PS pump** are dual return barbs. Borgeson spec says one should be capped.

## Critical Lesson — Fact Before Logic
Multiple failures from reasoning instead of checking:
1. "Cut all hoses" → should have identified each first
2. "PS pump has 2 ports" → FSM documents 3 connections
3. "No O-ring needed" → had to walk back after Cody asked to verify
4. "Just splice it, $2 at O'Reilly" → didn't know hose size, part number, or if aftermarket existed
**Root cause: every answer was based on what I THOUGHT should be true, not what the FSM or verified sources SAID.**

## Steering Component Compatibility Confirmed
- Skyjacker FA400 drop pitman arm: 32-spline, compatible with RedHead 2869-3T output shaft
- Drop arm is correct choice for ~4" lift (corrects drag link geometry)
- Borgeson 925117 hose kit: pressure hose (M16×1.5 O-ring at pump) + return hose (3/8" barb at pump, Borgeson has 2 barbs with 1 capped)

## Clockspring / Steering Wheel
- Master spline (flat section) on column = keyed alignment, ensures wheel mounts in one position only
- Clockspring centers on its own internal stops: full CW → 2.5 turns CCW
- Wheel spoke straight-ahead adjusted later via drag link
- Wheel easy to remove for LRB dash install — just center nut, master spline ensures exact repositioning

## Rear Bench Seat — Jack Bracket NEEDED
- Rear bench uses J-hooks on seat back that hook over rear wall brackets
- Driver-side bracket LEFT IN PLACE — confirmed needed for seat support
- Passenger-side bracket already removed — need to verify bench still fits with only driver-side bracket

## Wiring Prep Notes (for later)
- **Before headliner:** Route ham radio coax (Yaesu FTM-510DR), red LED strip wiring, verify dome light wiring
- **Before carpet (final):** Speaker wire runs (passenger side), audio power wire 4AWG (driver side), floor-level power/ground runs to house battery area
- **Rear speakers:** Cut at junction where they branch off dome light harness. Keep grounds at factory locations (star ground for new circuits only).

## Open Items
- Engine won't hold idle — fires on START, dies on release to RUN. Check FSS voltage first (2 min with Simpson). If 0V = another loose connector. If 12V = fuel/air issue, prime system.
- Need coolant top-off (lost some when radiator hose pulled)
- Need Loctite 242 (blue) for Borgeson shaft — **CONFIRM Cody has it**
- Need correct size cotter pins ×2 — **CONFIRM Cody has them**
- Need anti-seize for box mounting bolts — **CONFIRM**
- Need coolant — **CONFIRM**
- Verify bench seat fits with only driver-side rear bracket
- Park lamp short still undiagnosed (exterior, suspect 7-pin trailer connector)
- Wheels/tires: $2,225 in Discount Tire cart, buy when truck drives
- O'Reilly loaner torque wrench — pick up first thing tomorrow

## Parts Arriving Overnight
