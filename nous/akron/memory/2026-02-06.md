# Akron Memory — 2026-02-06 (Thursday)

## Session Summary

### Morning/Afternoon: Interior Rebuild Day 1 — Harness Work + Diagnostic
- Full SRS harness removal: 2 yellow connector wires pulled entirely, 10 black connector wires traced to destinations, cut, heat shrunk, labeled
- Key wire tracing: 5→bulkhead (ASDM), 2→DLC/CCD bus, 1→fuse #12 (yanked), 1→cluster, 1→shared splice (wiper preserved)
- BK/OR wire researched via 1998 FSM (2356-page PDF from spillage.net): identified as A22 (IGN RUN) or Z3 (ground), not SRS-specific
- Dash frame sanded, cleaned, Rust Reformer applied
- Battery on NOCO charger overnight
- AC plastics cleaned
- 61 truck photos copied from NAS to ../../../theke/akron/photos/2026-02-06/
- Harness brought inside for evening rewrap work

### Evening: Build Alignment + Purchases + Long-term Planning
- Stepped through entire build plan with Cody to ensure alignment after Syn's infra overhaul
- **ORDERED:** Mechman 370A Billet Elite Power Package from CE Auto Electric Supply (Order #51082, $1,288.76) — alternator + 3/0 AWG battery cables + Big 3 kit
- **DECIDED:** AirDog upgraded to II-5G DF-165 ($816, part# A7SABD524) — buy after alternator
- **DECIDED:** Numbered docs (00-06) in theke are THE source of truth. Workspace docs secondary.
- **COMPLETED:** Full doc consolidation via two sub-agents — all 7 numbered docs surgically updated, 10 redundant files archived
- Confirmed three-system electrical architecture (Factory 12V / Garmin PowerSwitch / House Power)
- Marine wire brand confirmed: Custom Cable and Wire (customcableusa.com, Order #25749, $227.89)

**Build Philosophy Deep Dive:**
- Turbo: stock HX35W rebuild is right answer for 280-320 HP target — no upgrade needed, saves $1,500-3,000
- No reason to push past 280-320 HP: 46RE ceiling, cascade of stress on supporting systems, use case doesn't need it
- Fuel system: AirDog + CAT dual filter for fuel cleanliness AND alt fuel capability (P7100 runs on diesel, kerosene, heating oil, Jet-A, biodiesel, WVO)
- Modern reliability upgrades added to 05_gap-analysis: replace all rubber hoses/lines with silicone/stainless (~$900-1,300 total). Tork Tek overflow valve + FSS, pinned water pump, poly bushings.
- NV5600 + 4.56 gears + 35" tires is ~$10-12K total — save up, do all at once as final drivetrain config

**Audio System Decisions:**
- Cody is audiophile — Sony NW-WM1AM2 Walkman (4.4mm balanced), signal chain matters
- Source: WM1AM2 → LDAC → Sony XAV-9000ES → preouts → amps
- 2-speaker front component + sub, NO rear speakers (pull wire to rear while apart)
- 6x9 component set for front doors (Morel Tempo Ultra 692 leading candidate ~$350)
- Factory Infinity system: has separate tweeter + woofer mounting in doors — perfect for components
- Factory Infinity amp is dead weight — remove during teardown (ground loop risk)
- JL Audio RD500/1 → 12TW1-2 sub in Q-Customs box (already owned)

**Interior Comfort:**
- Custom seat rebuild: horsehair + natural latex padding, merino wool wrap, all seats
- $2,000-3,400 at traditional upholstery shop — Phase 6 comfort item
- Southwest blanket covers (ActiveRVUpholstery Etsy) as interim protection
- Exhaust $600 line item is for Y-pipe to muffler (quiet mode), NOT replacing Diamond Eye

### Corrections Made
- BK/OR wire: NOT SRS-specific, likely A22 or Z3 per FSM research
- 600Ah battery: doc artifact, actual plan 100Ah now + maybe 100Ah later
- Mechman 370A: confirmed correct (not overkill) for lifetime diesel generator use case
- All numbered docs corrected: fuse problem (#18 not #13), SRS status, phase costs, battery specs

## 2026-02-07

### Morning: Seat Cleaning + Carpet Prep (09:00+)

**Seat Cleaning Process (documented):**
1. Hose spray (jet) — blast loose dirt
2. Homemade detergent mix: laundry detergent, washing soda, borax, sodium percarbonate (oxygen bleach), lemon extract
3. Scrub with drill + stiff brush attachment
4. 10 min dwell time
5. Hose rinse
6. Dry in sun (3-4 hrs)
7. Lysol Fabric spray (apply after mostly dry, not while soaking)
8. Seat frames treated with Rust Reformer while fabric dries

**Day's Plan:**
1. ~~Clean seats~~ (done, drying in sun with Lysol Fabric finish)
2. ~~Seat frames → Rust Reformer~~ (during dry time)
3. ~~Remove factory jack bracket~~ (passenger side removed, driver side kept for bench seat support)
4. ~~Lay carpet~~ (in progress — transfer case slit done, firewall trimmed, fitting)
5. ~~Rough Country lighting FULLY REMOVED~~ (switch pod, cab wiring, 2x 40A fuses, 2x relays, all extensions)
6. Remove rear speakers (Kickers — still pending)
7. Harness rewrap (X-Fasten + split loom at metal crossings)
8. Column install (3x 13mm + 2x 10mm)
9. Borgeson shaft upper end to column
10. Dash frame mount
11. LRB shell over frame

**RC Lighting Removal Details:**
- 2x RC branded switches + dimmer in switch pod (cab)
- All cab-to-firewall switch wiring removed
- 2x 40A inline fuses on air box (engine bay) — fuses pulled, holders left
- 2x Bosch relays on bracket near battery (driver side) — removed
- Battery ring terminal feed disconnected
- Lights physically still on truck but electrically dead
- **Diagnostic value:** If fuse #18 stops blowing with RC isolated, found the short

**Transfer Case Tunnel Inspection (while open for carpet):**
- No chafed wires ✅
- No liquid/leaks ✅ (confirms leak was old PS system)
- Edges covered with Stiles foam for future chafe prevention
- Rust Reformer applied to opening edges
- Inner dust boot needs replacement (worn rubber)

**Carpet Install Notes:**
- Stock Interiors Item #694, Ultra-Plush Cut Pile, Maroon 1045, MassBack backing
- Transfer case: + slit for lever, carpet goes UNDER bezel plate, bezel screws through carpet
- Firewall: trim excess, only needs ~2-3" up from floor bend (kick panels hide edge)
- Sides: leave 1/2" to tuck under sill plates
- 4WD shift knob: pop pattern cap, remove nut underneath, threads off

**Aftermarket Electrical Inventory (confirmed):**
- Rough Country lighting — NOW REMOVED
- Sony XAV-9000ES head unit (hardwired)
- JL Audio RD500/1 amp + T-Spec wiring (ring terminal at battery — likely amp power feed, KEEP for VFDB2)
- Predator DC2 trailer brake controller
- Hidden 7-pin trailer connector (behind roll pan — potential fuse #18 source)
- Trailer wiring harness

**Lesson Learned:**
- Rubber-stamped jack bracket removal without researching bench seat support function
- Cody caught it on driver side — saved that bracket
- Rule: ALWAYS research before approving removal. Spawn agent if needed for responsiveness.

**Photos:**
- 61 photos from 2026-02-06 cataloged by 3 sub-agents
- Merged index at workspace/photos/2026-02-06/PHOTO_INDEX.md
- 7 notable photos flagged (fuse corrosion, worst rust, SRS removal, PCM tape repair, harness condition)

---

### Open Threads (End of Day — 2026-02-06)
**CRITICAL PATH TO DRIVING:**
1. Finish harness rewrap
2. Harness back in
3. Carpet → column → RedHead + Borgeson steering → dash → clockspring → seats → belts
4. TIRES (before driving — very worn, need replacement)
5. Alignment

**SAFETY (First 30 Days):**
- Valve adjustment (NEVER done by current owner — most important mech item)
- Front wheel bearings + ball joints inspection during steering install
- Tires — cheap tires if NV5600 within 12 months, mid-tier if longer
- Park lamp short diagnosis from rear of truck after reassembly

**ORDERS TRACKING:**
- Mechman Power Package — CE Auto Order #51082, $1,288.76 (processing)
- Crutchfield audio order — ~$1,230 (Sony XM-4ES + Morel + accessories)

**OTHER OPEN:**
- Speaker wire: pull to front doors only (rears deleted)
- Factory Infinity amp: locate and remove during teardown
- Custom seat upholstery shop research (Austin/Pflugerville area)
- Getac K120 RAM mount (no mount yet)
- Teardrop/trailer parts need removal from database
- Coolant spec decision needed (SCA vs ELC for wet-sleeve)
- Front axle locker research (ARB for Dana 60)
- Interior build spec written: `reference/interior-build-spec.md`
- Transfer case inner dust boot replacement (worn)
- Hidden 7-pin trailer connector behind roll pan — inspect for fuse #18 short
- T-Spec amp wire at battery — confirm identity, keep for VFDB2 dist block
- Verify bench seat fits without passenger side jack bracket

---

## Session: Interior Rebuild Day 1 — Harness Work + Diagnostic

### Identity Confirmation
- Session started with identity confusion — Syn was loading in Akron's slot. Resolved by /new reset. Confirmed Akron identity.

## CRITICAL CORRECTION: The Fuse Problem

**Previous documentation was WRONG about which fuse.**

| What we said | Reality |
|---|---|
| "10A illumination fuse blows" | **#18 PARK LAMP (15A) blows** |
| Fuse #13 ILLUM is the problem | **#13 ILLUM (5A) is fine, not blown** |
| Short is behind dash | **Short is downstream of headlight switch, in body/exterior wiring** |

### Actual Symptoms
1. Dash gauge lights do not illuminate
2. Rear running lights not on (tail lights for night driving)
3. Brake lights work fine (separate circuit, fuse #20)
4. Fuse #18 PARK LAMP (15A) blows INSTANTLY — even 20A blows instantly = dead short
5. Fuse #13 ILLUM (5A) is intact and functional

### Why Dash Lights Don't Work
The park lamp circuit (#18) feeds through the headlight switch. When it blows, everything downstream goes dark — including the illumination dimmer circuit that lights the gauges. The ILLUM fuse (#13) feeds radio/cluster/HVAC backlighting independently but the headlight switch activation is what triggers both circuits.

### Diagnostic Done Today
- Simpson 260-8P on Rx1, tested fuse #18 slot to ground
- **No short detected** — because headlight switch is disconnected (part of removed dash)
- The short is downstream of the headlight switch in the body wiring
- **Next step:** Test from rear of truck (tail light connectors, trailer plug, license plate lights) or reconnect headlight switch and test with fuse in

- Old plastic dash fully stripped from metal frame
- Dash frame with wiring sitting in truck bed
- Sound deadening complete
- New carpet sitting loose in cab
- LRB dash mostly assembled (separate from truck)
- All interior components removed (seats, headliner, plastics, belts)

### What Cody Is Doing Now
- Unwrapping entire main dash harness
- Tracing and removing SRS sub-harness wires
- Inspecting all wiring for damage
- Re-wrapping fresh with X-Fasten harness tape
- Adding split loom where wires cross metal edges

### Remaining Today
1. Finish harness work
2. Lay carpet
3. Reinstall steering column (3x 13mm firewall nuts, 2x 10mm bracket bolts)
4. Install LRB dash on metal frame
5. Install clockspring on column (full CW, 2.5 turns CCW, yellow mark visible)
6. Install seats (35 ft-lbs, sequence: front inner → front outer → rear inner → rear outer)

## Parts Documented This Session

| Item | Details | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Simpson 260-8P Multimeter | Analog VOM, audible continuity, overload protection | $91.96 |
| Pitman Arm Nut + Lock Washer | Mopar J3200501 Stainless | $19.47 |
| CR/SKF Radial Shaft Seal 12411 | 1.250" shaft, 1.979" OD — application TBD | $14.06 |

### Battery Specs (Photographed)
- NAPA, Part 84xx (partially obscured)
- 810 CCA @ 0°F
- RC: 140
- Serial: 12000134
- Type: Standard flooded lead-acid (fill caps visible)
- Nut size: 14mm

### Ground Points Documented
- **Ground #1:** Right side of dash frame, glovebox area, 5/16 nut, single ring terminal

---

## Key Decisions

### Steering System Clarification
- **Steering column STAYS** — it's the housing with tilt, ignition, turn signals
- **Borgeson 000950** replaces only the intermediate shaft (column → steering box)
- **Three separate components:** Wheel → Column (reuse) → Intermediate shaft (Borgeson) → Box (RedHead)
- Cody initially thought it was all one rod — clarified

### SRS Wiring — FULLY DOCUMENTED
- SRS is a dedicated sub-harness — BOTH connectors confirmed plugged into ASDM module (photo from Aug 3, 2025)
- ASDM = Airbag System Diagnostic Module, mounted center floorboard under dash with SRS-labeled plastic cover
- Contains: internal crash sensor, driver/passenger squib controllers, warning lamp driver, diagnostic link
- Safe to trace and remove entirely — all 12 wires confirmed SRS-only
- Pull fuses #12 (AIRBAG CLUSTER) and #16 (AIRBAG) to depower
- Clockspring stays for future cruise control — SRS wires going to ASDM module are the ones being removed

#### Yellow Connector (2 wires, right 2 slots of 4-position plug)
1. Solid green
2. Black / blue stripe
→ Airbag squib wires — confirmed safe

#### Black Connector (10 wires)
Row 1: Black/light blue stripe, Peach, Black/orange stripe, Black/peach stripe
Row 2: Blue/light blue stripe, Light blue, White/black stripe, Purple/faint black-grey stripe, Blue/yellow stripe (or light green?), Green/yellow stripe
→ All SRS: driver squib, passenger squib, impact sensor, warning lamp, diagnostic, power/ground

### Interior Sequence
- Skip headliner (painting plastics later, routing wires under headliner later)
- Skip A-pillar covers and kick panels (same reason)
- Carpet → Column → Dash → Clockspring → Seats

### Grounding
- Factory grounds stay at factory locations — DON'T consolidate
- Clean each ground point to bare metal, star washer, dielectric grease around (not between) contact
- Star ground topology is for NEW aux power system only (Phase 3)

### Harness Cleanup
- X-Fasten fleece tape for re-wrapping
- Split loom where wires cross metal edges
- Heat shrink on any repairs
- Wire labels on connectors
- Save marine wire for aux power system — don't use on factory dash circuits
- Denatured alcohol fine for cleaning wiring and plastics (quick wipe on plastics, don't soak)

---

## Cleaning Notes
- **Metal dash frame:** Brake cleaner or Simple Green Pro HD
- **AC plastics:** Mild soap + water, or diluted Simple Green. NOT brake cleaner.
- **Denatured alcohol:** Fine for wiring/connectors. Quick wipe OK on plastics, don't soak.
- **Seats (cloth):** Hose + soap, stand upright in sun, need 3-4 hours to dry. Don't reinstall damp.

---

## Deliverables
- `workspace/akron-today-procedure.md` — full procedure for today's work
- `/mnt/metis/downloads/akron-today-procedure.docx` — printable version delivered to Metis

---

## Simpson 260-8P Quick Reference
- **Black lead:** COMMON jack (top left)
- **Red lead:** + jack
- **For resistance/short testing:** Function switch on +D.C., selector to Rx1, zero with ZERO OHMS knob
- Touch leads together → turn zero knob until needle reads 0 at right end
- 0Ω (needle swings right) = short
- ∞ (no movement) = open/no short

---

## End of Day Status (16:40 CST)

### Completed
- **All 12 SRS wires removed** (2 yellow connector + 10 black connector)
  - 9 black connector wires: cut, heat shrunk, taped, temp labeled at destination connectors
  - 1 black connector wire (blue/yellow to fuse #12): yanked entirely
  - 2 yellow connector wires: pulled entirely earlier
- **Dash frame:** sanded, cleaned, Rust Reformer applied
- **AC plastics:** cleaned and ready for reassembly
- **Battery:** on NOCO charger, staying overnight
- **61 truck photos** from today copied to `../../../theke/akron/photos/2026-02-06/` from NAS
- **Wiring harness** brought inside for evening work

### Tonight's Plan
- Sort, inspect, wrap, and label the main harness
- X-Fasten fleece tape + split loom at metal crossings

### Key Wire Tracing Results
All 10 black connector wires traced to destinations:
- 5 → white bulkhead junction (ASDM pass-through, all SRS-only)
- 2 → DLC/OBD-II port (CCD bus pair, ASDM branch only)
- 1 → fuse #12 AIRBAG CLUSTER (yanked)
- 1 → dash cluster harness (SRS warning lamp signal)
- 1 → shared splice junction (SRS branch removed, wiper circuit preserved)

## Design Philosophy (confirmed 2026-02-06)
- **Healthy first** — fix what's broken, maintain what works
- **While you're there** — if it's already apart, do it right now instead of twice
- **Quality and reliability over brand** — best part for the job, not the most expensive sticker
- **Purpose-built** — daily driver, towing, self-reliance. Not a show truck.
- **BIFL on stress components** — alternator, wiring gauge, fusing, structural mounts. Overbuild every time.
- **370A Mechman is correct** — lifetime truck = diesel generator on wheels for future camper/trailer
- **Battery plan:** 100Ah LiFePO4 in cab now. Maybe second 100Ah later (toolbox or cab). NOT 600Ah — that was a doc artifact.
- **"Die with this truck"** — never optimizing for resale. Optimize for never doing it twice.
- **Cody is learning** — explain the WHY not just the WHAT. He has no ego about not knowing. Open to ideas within reason.
- **Not trying to be everything** — truck is the truck, bike is the bike, future Mopar is the Mopar.

## Parts Notes
- **Marine wire brand:** Custom Cable and Wire (tinned copper, multi-gauge kit)
- **AirDog decision:** Upgraded from 150 4G ($625) to II-5G DF-165 ($816, part# A7SABD524) — BIFL, demand flow recirc, adjustable pressure
- **Mechman 370A:** ORDERED — CE Auto Electric Supply Power Package (Order #51082, $1,288.76 total). 370A Billet Elite + 3/0 AWG battery cables + Big 3 kit. Processing.
- **Buy order:** Mechman first (unlocks Phase 3 electrical), AirDog second (install with/before injectors)

## Open Threads
1. **Park lamp short** — need to test downstream of headlight switch once dash reassembled, or test from rear
2. **Radio wiring** — Cody's blue butt connectors need redo with solder + heat shrink
3. **SKF seal 12411** — application not confirmed (steering box input? transfer case?)
4. **Pitman arm nut** — has both J3200501 stainless AND new castle nut in consumables — verify thread match for RedHead sector shaft
5. **Squeaking noise** in engine bay — probably belt tensioner or idler pulley, not urgent
6. **Remaining ground points** — #1 documented, more to come as Cody finds them

- Session state updated

### Late Evening: Audio + Interior + Full Build Review (21:18-23:17)

**Audio System Architecture Finalized:**
- Source: Sony NW-WM1AM2 Walkman → LDAC → Sony XAV-9000ES → preouts
- Front: 6x9 component set (Morel Tempo Ultra 692 leading candidate, ~$350) — 2-channel amp
- Sub: JL Audio 12TW1-2 in Q-Customs → RD500/1 monoblock
- Rear: DELETE speakers. Pull wire to all 4 locations while interior apart (future option).
- Cody confirmed audiophile preferences — 4.4mm balanced Walkman, signal chain matters

**Door Photo Analysis (Sep 4 2025 photo):**
- Kicker CS coaxials confirmed (6x9 front w/ dual tweeters, round rears)
- Factory Infinity tweeters were PANEL-mounted (in plastic door panel, not sheet metal)
- No tweeter hole in bare door metal — need sail panel mount for component tweeters
- Unknown round hole above Kicker in door metal — needs investigation
- Factory Infinity amp still in truck — locate and remove (dead weight, ground loop source)

**Speaker Fitment:**
- 1997 Ram Infinity: 6x9 front doors, 5.25" rears (Crutchfield data unreliable — forums say 6x9 + 5.25, not 6.5 all around)
- Front door 6x9 mounting depth needs verification before buying speakers
- Tweeter recommendation: sail panels (mirror triangle) — at ear level, clean install

**Custom Seats Confirmed:**
- Horsehair + natural latex padding, merino wool wrap
- All seats: front buckets + center jump seat + rear bench
- $2,000-3,400 at traditional/classic upholstery shop
- Phase 6 comfort item — factory seats + Southwest covers get truck driving now
- Research needed: local traditional upholstery shops (Austin/Pflugerville)

**NV5600 Swap Costed Out:**
- Full package (trans + clutch + flywheel/hydraulics + Tom Woods driveshaft + 4.56 gears both axles + 35" tires + labor): ~$10-12K realistic
- Save up, do all at once — everything depends on everything else (gears calculated for tire size, trans needs new driveshaft length, shop already has truck for gears)
- 46RE rebuilt and fine at 280-320 HP meanwhile

**Crutchfield Audio Order (~$1,230):**
- Sony XM-4ES 4-ch amplifier — $598
- Morel Tempo Ultra 692 MKII 6x9 components — $489
- T-Spec VFDB2 fused dist block — $25
- T-Spec 40A mini-ANL fuses (for XM-4ES) — $4
- Install Bay 50A mini-ANL fuses (for RD500/1) — $3
- EFX Delta 2-ch RCA 17ft twisted pair — $42
- Kicker wire-to-RCA adapters REMOVED (not needed — XAV-9000ES has RCA preouts)

**Interior Additions:**
- LRB overhead console (extended) — on hand, switches relocated here (cockpit layout)
- Red operational lighting — LED strip + PWM dimmer, house battery powered, night vision preservation
- Pistol safe — has one, upgrade later (Fort Knox FTK-PB mechanical recommended)
- Bed: low-profile toolbox, manual locking hard tonneau, 2 Wavian cans, maybe swing-out boxes

**Core Identity Statement (22:51):**
- "As long as they make diesel, I want it running. Be it for me, Coop, or just because."
- Over-engineering in simplicity. Anti-planned-obsolescence.
- The Corolla subscription for remote start broke something. This truck is the response.
- Top-3 importance. Connected to everything else he cares about.
- Teardrop trailer was a fantasy — officially dead, remove from plans
- Consumables: reusable over disposable wherever possible (K&N philosophy)
- Financial: 0% APR is a tool. The 401k game is someone else's game.

**Comprehensive Build Assessment:**
- Truck is ~70% to final form
- Total investment: ~$42K (purchase + parts). Completion: ~$50-55K.
- 121 parts tracked in database, $30,355 total
- Critical path to driving: harness → carpet → column → RedHead steering (box is 80% out!) → dash → clockspring → seats → belts → TIRES → alignment
- Steering install IS the critical path, not a separate day

**Gaps Identified:**
- Front axle locker (ARB in Dana 60 for Alaska/snow capability)
- Fuel tank switching system for dual tanks
- Brake fluid flush (add to disc upgrade)
- Coolant spec decision (wet-sleeve, SCA vs ELC)
- Steering damper inspect/replace
- Cruise control status
- Annual rust prevention (Fluid Film)
- Tires CRITICAL — very worn, need before driving
- No spare tire — planned with rear bumper swing-out

**Gaps Addressed:**
- AC: fully serviced by previous owner ✅
- Belt: good + spare on hand ✅
- Heater core: new within last 5 years ✅
- Door seals: new + hardware on hand ✅
- Exhaust $600: Y-pipe to muffler for quiet mode, NOT replacing Diamond Eye
- Cameras: NATIKA → Sony head unit, RV system separate — both accounted for
- Trans cooler: keeping stock, goes away with NV5600
- Front wheel bearings + ball joints flagged for inspection (307K, unknown history) — safety items, do during steering install

### Distillation (23:19)
- Extracted 2 facts
