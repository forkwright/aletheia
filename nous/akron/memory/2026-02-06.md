# Akron Memory — 2026-02-06 (Thursday)

## Session: Interior Rebuild Day 1 — Harness Work + Diagnostic

### Identity Confirmation

## CRITICAL CORRECTION: The Fuse Problem

**Previous documentation was WRONG about which fuse.**

| What we said | Reality |
|---|---|
| "10A illumination fuse blows" | **#18 PARK LAMP (15A) blows** |
| Fuse #13 ILLUM is the problem | **#13 ILLUM (5A) is fine, not blown** |
| Short is behind dash | **Short is downstream of headlight switch, in body/exterior wiring** |

### Actual Symptoms
1. Dash gauge lights do not illuminate
2. Rear running lights not on (tail lights for night driving)
3. Brake lights work fine (separate circuit, fuse #20)
4. Fuse #18 PARK LAMP (15A) blows INSTANTLY — even 20A blows instantly = dead short
5. Fuse #13 ILLUM (5A) is intact and functional

### Why Dash Lights Don't Work
The park lamp circuit (#18) feeds through the headlight switch. When it blows, everything downstream goes dark — including the illumination dimmer circuit that lights the gauges. The ILLUM fuse (#13) feeds radio/cluster/HVAC backlighting independently but the headlight switch activation is what triggers both circuits.

### Diagnostic Done Today
- Simpson 260-8P on Rx1, tested fuse #18 slot to ground
- **No short detected** — because headlight switch is disconnected (part of removed dash)
- The short is downstream of the headlight switch in the body wiring
- **Next step:** Test from rear of truck (tail light connectors, trailer plug, license plate lights) or reconnect headlight switch and test with fuse in

## Current Truck State

### What's Done
- Battery on NOCO charger (12V standard mode, flooded lead-acid)
- Old plastic dash fully stripped from metal frame
- Dash frame with wiring sitting in truck bed
- Sound deadening complete
- New carpet sitting loose in cab
- LRB dash mostly assembled (separate from truck)
- All interior components removed (seats, headliner, plastics, belts)

### What Cody Is Doing Now
- Unwrapping entire main dash harness
- Tracing and removing SRS sub-harness wires
- Inspecting all wiring for damage
- Re-wrapping fresh with X-Fasten harness tape
- Adding split loom where wires cross metal edges

### Remaining Today
1. Finish harness work
2. Lay carpet
3. Reinstall steering column (3x 13mm firewall nuts, 2x 10mm bracket bolts)
4. Install LRB dash on metal frame
5. Install clockspring on column (full CW, 2.5 turns CCW, yellow mark visible)
6. Install seats (35 ft-lbs, sequence: front inner → front outer → rear inner → rear outer)

### Battery Specs (Photographed)
- NAPA, Part 84xx (partially obscured)
- 810 CCA @ 0°F
- RC: 140
- Serial: 12000134
- Type: Standard flooded lead-acid (fill caps visible)
- Nut size: 14mm

### Ground Points Documented
- **Ground #1:** Right side of dash frame, glovebox area, 5/16 nut, single ring terminal

## Key Decisions

### Steering System Clarification
- **Steering column STAYS** — it's the housing with tilt, ignition, turn signals
- **Borgeson 000950** replaces only the intermediate shaft (column → steering box)
- **Three separate components:** Wheel → Column (reuse) → Intermediate shaft (Borgeson) → Box (RedHead)
- Cody initially thought it was all one rod — clarified

### SRS Wiring
- SRS is a dedicated sub-harness with yellow connectors
- Safe to trace and remove entirely
- Pull fuses #12 (AIRBAG CLUSTER) and #16 (AIRBAG) to depower
- Does NOT share circuits with any other system
- Clockspring stays for future cruise control — SRS wires going to ASDM module are the ones being removed

### Interior Sequence
- Skip headliner (painting plastics later, routing wires under headliner later)
- Skip A-pillar covers and kick panels (same reason)
- Carpet → Column → Dash → Clockspring → Seats

### Grounding
- Factory grounds stay at factory locations — DON'T consolidate
- Clean each ground point to bare metal, star washer, dielectric grease around (not between) contact
- Star ground topology is for NEW aux power system only (Phase 3)

### Harness Cleanup
- X-Fasten fleece tape for re-wrapping
- Split loom where wires cross metal edges
- Heat shrink on any repairs
- Wire labels on connectors
- Save marine wire for aux power system — don't use on factory dash circuits
- Denatured alcohol fine for cleaning wiring and plastics (quick wipe on plastics, don't soak)

---

## Cleaning Notes
- **Metal dash frame:** Brake cleaner or Simple Green Pro HD
- **AC plastics:** Mild soap + water, or diluted Simple Green. NOT brake cleaner.
- **Denatured alcohol:** Fine for wiring/connectors. Quick wipe OK on plastics, don't soak.
- **Seats (cloth):** Hose + soap, stand upright in sun, need 3-4 hours to dry. Don't reinstall damp.

## Deliverables
- `workspace/akron-today-procedure.md` — full procedure for today's work
- `/mnt/metis/downloads/akron-today-procedure.docx` — printable version delivered to Metis

## Simpson 260-8P Quick Reference
- **Black lead:** COMMON jack (top left)
- **Red lead:** + jack
- **For resistance/short testing:** Function switch on +D.C., selector to Rx1, zero with ZERO OHMS knob
- Touch leads together → turn zero knob until needle reads 0 at right end
- 0Ω (needle swings right) = short
- ∞ (no movement) = open/no short

---

## Open Threads
1. **Park lamp short** — need to test downstream of headlight switch once dash reassembled, or test from rear
2. **Radio wiring** — Cody's blue butt connectors need redo with solder + heat shrink
3. **SKF seal 12411** — application not confirmed (steering box input? transfer case?)
4. **Pitman arm nut** — has both J3200501 stainless AND new castle nut in consumables — verify thread match for RedHead sector shaft
5. **Squeaking noise** in engine bay — probably belt tensioner or idler pulley, not urgent
6. **Remaining ground points** — #1 documented, more to come as Cody finds them
