# Akron Memory — 2026-02-07 (Friday)

## Session Summary

### Morning: Carpet, Seats, Jack Bracket
- Seats cleaned (hose → homemade detergent → drill+brush → rinse → sun dry → Lysol Fabric)
- Seat frames treated with Rust Reformer during dry time
- Passenger side factory jack bracket removed (4 floor bolts + 1 side wall bolt)
- Driver side bracket LEFT IN PLACE — potential rear bench seat support
- **Lesson learned:** Don't rubber-stamp removal. Documented in MEMORY.md
- Carpet installation started — Stock Interiors Item #694 maroon, transfer case + slit done
- Transfer case tunnel inspected: no chafed wires, no leaks (confirms PS system was leak source), Rust Reformer applied
- Transfer case inner dust boot needs replacement (worn rubber)
- 4WD shift knob removal: pop pattern cap → nut underneath → threads off

### Midday: Engine Bay Audit + Aftermarket Removal
- **Rough Country lighting FULLY REMOVED:**
  - Switch pod (2x RC switches + dimmer) from cab
  - All cab-to-firewall switch wiring
  - 2x 40A inline fuses on air box
  - 2x Bosch relays on bracket near driver battery
  - Battery feed ring terminal disconnected
  - All 5 light fixtures unplugged (1 bar + 4 squares)
  - RC system isolated as diagnostic step for fuse #18
- **Identified stock components (DO NOT TOUCH):**
  - Battery temperature sensor (driver tray bottom) — thermistor for charge compensation
  - Grid heater relays ×2 (PN 56019405) — 90A each, critical cold start
  - PTO provision wire (orange, driver firewall) — unused factory stub
  - All battery wiring confirmed factory on both batteries
- **Aftermarket kept:**
  - Retro Antenna HPA 7 — hidden AM/FM on inner fender, feeds XAV-9000ES
  - Predator DC2 brake controller
  - Hidden 7-pin trailer connector behind roll pan

### Afternoon: Harness Inspection, Repair, Rewrap (3 hours, 4 rolls tape)
- **CRITICAL FIND — Possible fuse #18 cause:**
  - Black/orange ground wires to BOTH cigarette lighters: severely melted insulation, exposed copper
  - Located between passenger side ground junction and cigarette lighter cables
  - Exposed copper ground wire = direct short-to-ground for any adjacent park lamp wire
  - Theory: repeated fuse #18 blows heated the ground wires → insulation failed → permanent short path
  - **REPAIRED:** Cut out damaged section, spliced 16AWG gray marine wire, blue butt connectors
  - Second wire cosmetically damaged (contact heat) but copper intact — heat shrink reinforced
- **OBD-II taps removed:**
  - Pink (Pin 16, constant 12V) + Black (Pin 4/5 ground) had blue splice connectors
  - Previous owner alarm/remote start tap — device long gone
  - Connectors removed, wires properly rejoined
- **Black/green stripe splice near fuse box:** Was bare twist, fixed with butt connector
- **Radio wires documented and capped:**
  - Orange = illumination/dimmer (park lamp circuit, not needed — XAV auto-dims)
  - Brown/Red = Left Front Speaker (−)
  - Green = Left Front Speaker (+)
  - Purple = Right Front Speaker (+)
  - Purple/Red = Right Front Speaker (−)
- **Passenger side connectors documented:**
  - Orange plug (2-pin, larger gauge) = likely blower motor power
  - Small white (4-pin) = HVAC controls
  - Big blue (8-pin) = instrument/accessory
  - Big white (8-pin) = power distribution
  - Glovebox bulb = pink + black/orange
- **Ground junction documented:**
  - Black/orange = cigarette lighter grounds (REPAIRED)
  - Black/white = instrument/HVAC ground
- **Unused factory provision connector** near fuse box (green/blue/white housing, many pins) — TBD, could be useful for future circuits
- Full harness cleaned with denatured alcohol, inspected end-to-end, rewrapped with X-Fasten fleece tape

### Late Afternoon: Dash Reassembly
- Harness reinstalled on dash frame
- Dash frame reinstalled in truck
- Steering column mounted
- All accessible connectors plugged in
- **NOT connected (need LRB dash):** Headlight switch, dash cluster, AC controls, radio, cigarette lighters, clockspring, cruise control
- Power test recommended before LRB covers everything — but headlight switch needs temporary connection for fuse #18 test

### Soldering Notes
- Cody has Fantik iron, Thermaltronics flux paste, Kester 44 solder
- Recommended 680°F, chisel tip, tin separately then join
- Butt connectors are acceptable for non-critical ground wires
- Adhesive-lined heat shrink + ratcheting crimper = proper crimp

## Decisions Made
- RC lights → Garmin PowerSwitch when reinstalled (dedicated circuits, no factory taps)
- Harness wrap as one bundle, not domain-separated (Phase 3 for full separation)
- Denatured alcohol fine for cleaning wires and connector housings
- AC ducting goes on BEFORE LRB dash shell
- Factory grounds stay at factory locations (star washer, bare metal, dielectric grease around contact)

## New Documents Created
- `BACKLOG.md` — Someday/maybe ideas including complete electrical system redesign
- `theke/.../reference/electrical-system-map.md` — Circuit-by-circuit map for future harness redesign
- `workspace/research/harness-connector-map.md` — Wire colors by connector

## Key Correction
- Previous session had documented "amp wire at battery" — actually the JL Audio RD500/1 was NEVER installed. Ring terminal at battery was likely RC lighting or unidentified.

## Open Threads
- **Fuse #18 test** — need headlight switch connected temporarily
- **LRB dash installation** — next major step
- **AC ducting** — must go on before LRB
- **Seats** — were drying all day, should be ready
- **Transfer case inner dust boot** — needs replacement
- **Hidden 7-pin trailer connector** — inspect for park lamp short (backup if fuse #18 still blows after repair)
- **3rd RC circuit wire** — untraced in engine bay, low priority
- **Complete electrical redesign** — future project, BACKLOG.md
- **Rear speakers** — still need removal (Kickers)

### Evening: Dash Reassembly, Electrical Testing, Philosophy, Research

#### Dash Reassembly
- Harness reinstalled on dash frame, frame back in truck
- Steering column mounted
- All accessible connectors plugged in
- Identified remaining unplugged connectors:
  - Yellow/tan = clockspring (SRS removed, horn only)
  - Gray small = cruise control
  - Gray at key = key cylinder light + key-in buzzer
  - Black = OD OFF switch (46RE overdrive lockout)
  - Headlight switch, cluster, AC, radio, cigarette lighters = wait for LRB

#### Electrical Testing
- Battery connected, key to RUN — headlights work at 2nd position, buzzer works
- **Fuse #18 STILL BLOWS** with fresh 15A — melted cigarette lighter ground was NOT the sole cause
- Short confirmed DOWNSTREAM in body/exterior wiring (entire dash harness inspected)
- **Suspect #1:** Hidden 7-pin trailer connector behind roll pan
- No-crank attempt: single click at starter = signal path works, insufficient amps
- **ROOT CAUSE OF BATTERY DRAIN FOUND:** Brake light switch rubber bumper missing
  - Brake lights ON 24/7 for 6+ months (since purchase/disassembly)
  - 63W constant draw (~5A) drained both batteries continuously
  - Every NOCO charge session was fighting constant drain
  - Taped plunger depressed as temp fix — 3rd brake light went out
  - Need Dorman 76942 replacement bumper (~$2)
- Both loose ring terminals at driver battery confirmed POSITIVE (grid heater + main harness feed)
- One harness ground wire still not connected — find and connect tomorrow

#### Build Philosophy Crystallized
- **"Not repaired to stock, not restomodded. Utterly reengineered where possible for unparalleled endurance."**
- Toys (Sony, Garmin) ride on top — the foundation is what survives
- Analog over digital where we don't lose anything
- No computer between switch and load where a wire will do
- The ἄκρον methodology: don't bypass — eliminate
- Anti-entropy: every session, the truck gets closer to ἄκρον
- Full electrical redesign philosophy doc created: `reference/electrical-redesign-philosophy.md`
- Aerospace wire routing: individual runs, P-clips, Deutsch DT/DTM connectors, labeled both ends
- Three questions for every wire: What component? What if it fails? Can a human diagnose in a field?

#### Naming Confirmed
- Akron works at all three layers: agent, project, truck
- Demiurge and Syn consulted — unanimous agreement
- Not "peak" as aspiration — peak as exposed bedrock, what remains after erosion
- Updated naming_system.md with L1-L6:
  - L5: "The physical proof that simplicity is not primitive but permanent"
  - L6: "Autarkeia made steel"

#### Wheels & Tires Decision
- Downsizing from 18" Moto Metal to 17" confirmed
- **Wheels:** Black steel, 17x8, 8x6.5 (Pro Comp or Vision Soft 8, ~$100/ea)
  - BIFL: field-repairable, available everywhere, honest
  - Forged aluminum considered but steel wins on repairability
- **Tires: BFG KO2 35x12.50R17 Load Range E** (changed from MT/R Kevlar)
  - 50-60K mile tread life (vs 25-35K for MT/R)
  - 50,000 mile warranty
  - 3PMSF snow rated (Alaska capable)
  - Load E (10-ply) proper for 8,800 GVWR + gooseneck
  - MT/R Kevlar only available Load C/D in this size — not enough
- Total rolling package: ~$2,200-2,500 for 5+5
- Sell Moto Metals ($400-600) to offset
- Pair with 4.56 regear when budget allows

#### Battery Upgrade Research
- If current batteries don't recover from 6-month drain: Odyssey ODX-AGM31M
- TPPL AGM, 1,150 CCA, 4,500 lb military/aerospace heritage
- ~$350-400/ea, ~$700-800 pair
- Sealed, maintenance-free, extreme temp range, dual terminals

## Tomorrow (Feb 8) Plan
1. NOCO both batteries overnight → check full charge morning
2. Connect missing harness ground
3. Buy Dorman 76942 brake light switch bumper
4. Clean battery terminals (wire brush + dielectric grease)
5. Start engine
6. Install steering system: RedHead 2869-3T → pitman arm → drag link → Borgeson 000950 → PS hoses → ATF+4 bleed
7. Install Forever Sharp steering wheel + A17 adapter
8. Move truck under own power

### Late Evening: Wheel, Tire & Gear Research (21:37-23:10)

#### Wheel Decision
- Downsizing from 18" Moto Metal to 17" confirmed
- Steel wheels chosen over aluminum — BIFL, field-repairable, available everywhere
- **FINAL: Vision 85 Soft 8, PN 85H7981NS**
  - 17×9, 8×165.1, -12mm offset, 4.5" backspace
  - 130.8mm hub bore, 3,650 lb load rating, 38 lbs, gloss black steel
  - $115/wheel × 5 = ~$575
- No 17×8.5 steel wheel exists in 8×165.1 — only 17×8 or 17×9
- Vision 353 Turbine eliminated — cast aluminum, not steel
- Rough Country RC51-7865 — out of stock everywhere

#### Tire Decision (evolved through research)
1. Started: Goodyear MT/R Kevlar 35×12.50R17 → only Load C, not enough
2. Changed: BFG KO2 35×12.50R17 Load E → solid but not best tread life
3. Sub-agent recommended: Falken AT3W LT315/70R17 Load E → best tread depth + warranty
4. **DISCOVERED: AT3W is DISCONTINUED** (replaced by AT4W, which is Load C only in this size)
5. **FINAL: BFGoodrich KO3 LT315/70R17 Load F (12-ply)**
   - PN: BFG68284, 128/125S, 3,970 lbs max load
   - 16/32" tread, 3PMSF snow rated, 50K mile warranty
   - ~$380/tire × 5 = ~$1,900
   - Available: Big O Tires, Custom Offsets
- Key insight: KO3 in flotation 35×12.50R17 = Load D only. KO3 in metric LT315/70R17 = Load F. **Metric size unlocks Load F.**

#### Gear Decision
- **Yukon YG D60-456** (Dana 60 front) + **YG D70-456** (Dana 70 rear) — 4.56:1
- Pro install, ~$1,800 total
- Consider ARB Air Locker for Dana 60 front (open diff) during same install

#### Phasing Decision
- **Phase A — NOW:** Wheels + tires (~$2,500). Independent of gears.
- **Phase B — NEXT:** 4.56 gears (~$1,800 pro install). Independent of trans.
- **Phase C — WHEN READY:** NV5600 + driveshaft + vacuum delete (~$8-12K)
- Each phase delivers tangible improvement. No dependencies.

#### Math Verified
- RPM = (MPH × Axle × Trans_OD × 336) / Tire_Dia
- Current (33", 3.54, 0.69 OD): 1,617 RPM @ 65 mph
- With new tires (34.6", 3.54): 1,542 RPM @ 65 mph — acceptable
- After gears (34.6", 4.56): 1,987 RPM @ 65 mph — perfect
- No driveline angle concerns — tire size doesn't change angles
- Dana 60/70 handle 4.8% more leverage without issue
- -12mm offset = less bearing stress than Moto Metal's aggressive offset

#### Near-Miss: Wrong Bolt Pattern
- Cody almost filtered for 8×170mm (Ford Super Duty)
- **Correct: 8×165.1mm (8×6.5")** — caught before purchase

## Key Corrections This Session
- Fuse #18 short is NOT in dash harness — confirmed downstream in body/exterior wiring
- Gray column connector is cruise control, NOT ignition switch (corrected mid-session)
- Brake light drain explains 6 months of dead batteries — not a battery quality issue
- Falken AT3W is DISCONTINUED — cannot be sourced new
- KO3 availability depends on size format: flotation = Load D max, metric = Load F available

### Late-Late Evening: Purchase Finalization, Lift, Brakes (22:25-00:00)

#### Tire/Wheel Purchase Finalized
- Cody searched Discount Tire, caught several near-misses:
  - LT285/70R17 (wrong size — too small)
  - MT01 (wrong model — mud terrain)
  - 8×170mm filter (wrong bolt pattern — Ford)
- **Final in cart at Discount Tire:** 4× KO3 LT315/70R17 128S E2 + 4× wheels = **$2,225**
- Falken Rubitrek A/T considered ($323, Load E, 20/32" tread) — Cody chose KO3 for durability
- Discount Tire Load Range labels: D1=8-ply, E1=10-ply, E2=12-ply (Load F)
- Buy when truck is running. 5th spare later.

#### Lift Assessment
- Full suspension documented from photo + Cody's input:
  - Front: Thuren XS coils (+2") + PRP spacers (+2") + HBS arms + Thuren shocks = ~4"
  - Rear: Fabricated steel blocks (~4", needs measuring) + Bilstein shocks + stock leafs
- Total height over stock: ~78-79" (stock ~74")
- 34.4" tires on 4" lift = some wheel well gap but not comical — "working truck, not show truck"
- **Decision: keep ~4" lift** — ground clearance, approach angles, visibility, future 37" compatibility
- Future improvement: replace rear blocks with proper springs (add-a-leafs or full pack)

#### Brake System — Full BIFL Build Researched
- Cody wants Tier 3: no-compromise, reengineer the entire brake system
- **Hydroboost conversion** (PN 3083-2772-435, ~$1,877)
  - Replaces vacuum booster with hydraulic booster from PS pump
  - 1,200-2,000 PSI vs 900 PSI from vacuum booster
  - Eliminates vacuum pump dependency
  - Pairs with Borgeson PS pump already on hand
  - Source: Pure Diesel Power / Circle Track Supply
- **EGR rear disc conversion** (EGR4601-X1, ~$1,268)
  - Bolt-on Dana 70 SRW kit with parking brake calipers
  - Vented rotors, carbon Kevlar pads, stainless lines
  - Saves 60 lbs over drums
  - 2-3 hrs/side, no welding
- **Front premium rebuild** (~$920)
  - Hawk Talon drilled/slotted rotors + HPS pads
  - Raybestos Professional Grade calipers
  - Stainless braided flex hoses, Timken wheel bearings
- **System upgrades:**
  - EGR large bore master cylinder 1-5/16" (~$250)
  - Inline Tube stainless pre-bent hard line kit (~$300)
  - Wilwood adjustable proportioning valve (~$50)
  - Motul RBF 600 high-temp fluid (~$50)
- **Total: ~$4,815** for complete 4-wheel disc + hydroboost + stainless everything
- Future option: Ford Super Duty knuckle swap for front (twin-piston calipers, 13"+ rotors) when axle apart for gears
