# Akron Memory - 2026-02-03

## Major Finding: P7100 Pump Confirmed

**Visual inspection confirmed P7100 inline injection pump**, NOT ETB/VE as previously documented.

- Photo showed delivery valve holders in inline arrangement - classic P-pump
- Documentation updated: 00_master-vehicle-record.md, 01_specifications-history.md
- Created PUMP-CORRECTION.md in workspace/research/
- **All planned mods compatible:** #11 fuel plate, 4K governor springs, Hamilton valve springs, Dynomite injectors

Previous documentation was wrong - likely assumed ETB based on 1997 + automatic + possible CA emissions assumption.

## Research Archive Complete

All 13 sub-agents completed. Documents in `workspace/research/`:

| Document | Key Findings |
|----------|--------------|
| PUMP-CORRECTION.md | P7100 confirmed, ETB research not applicable |
| torque-specs-verified.md | Pitman arm: 185 ft-lbs (not 225) |
| np241-transfer-case-expert.md | DLD = "Dodge Light Duty", rear seal common leak |
| 46re-transmission-expert.md | Operating near torque limit, 15k fluid changes |
| dana-axle-expert.md | Power-Lok LSD needs 4oz friction modifier |
| cooling-system-expert.md | SCA NOT required (parent bore, no wet sleeves) |
| electrical-system-expert.md | 10A short diagnostic, trailer controller suspect |
| steering-suspension-expert.md | Track bar #1 death wobble cause, upgrade essential |
| maintenance-schedule-307k.md | Oil 5k overdue, trans 32.5k overdue, diffs 35.5k overdue |
| quick-reference-card.md | Printable garage reference (needs pitman torque fix) |
| resource-directory.md | mopar1973man.com, Cummins QuickServe, Geno's Garage |

## Data Sources

- **03_parts-inventory.md** has comprehensive parts list with costs (~$19,300-27,000 total)
- Database needs syncing from this document to fill gaps
- Proton email configured (himalaya) but bridge not running - can't search receipts remotely

## Pending Actions

1. Sync parts inventory doc → database
2. Fix pitman arm torque in quick-reference-card.md (185, not 225)
3. Update/replace ETB research doc with P7100 content
4. Find downloadable manuals: P7100 service manual, ATSG 46RE, Dana service manuals

## Valve Adjustment - CRITICAL

**Status:** NEVER performed by current owner (purchased 2025-04-18 at ~307,000 mi)
**Previous owner:** Unknown
**Interval:** Every 15,000 miles
**Risk:** At 307,500 miles with no known history, potentially 100,000-200,000 miles overdue

**Symptoms of maladjustment:**
- Hard starting (especially cold)
- Rough idle
- Reduced power
- Increased fuel consumption
- Exhaust smoke

**Specs (cold engine):**
- Intake: 0.010"
- Exhaust: 0.020"

**Priority:** Should be done BEFORE any significant driving/towing.


---

## Session 2: Deep Dive & 9-Day Plan

### Key Confirmations from Cody
- **Valve adjustment:** NEVER done by current owner (previous owner unknown)
- **Batteries:** Dead from sitting 6-7 months, need NOCO desulfation recovery
- **10A short:** Affects dash illumination AND rear running lights — day driving workaround until fixed
- **Carpet:** Already cut to size, just needs laying loose
- **Electrical scope:** Battery connectors + tender pigtails only (full aux system later)

### RAG System Fixed
- Rebuilt venv on worker-node with Python 3.12.3
- Installed sentence-transformers 5.2.2, lancedb 0.27.1, torch 2.10.0
- 45,371 chunks now queryable
- Note: RAG has TSBs/parts catalogs, NOT detailed torque specs in procedures

### Research Agents Completed (6 total)
| Agent | Output |
|-------|--------|
| akron-valve-procedure | `procedures/07_valve-adjustment.md` |
| akron-electrical-diagnosis | `procedures/08_10a-short-diagnosis.md` |
| akron-p7100-expert | `research/p7100-injection-pump-expert.md` |

| akron-torque-verification | `research/torque-spec-fsm-verification.md` (RAG gap found) |
| akron-manual-finder | Downloaded Borgeson PDFs, found sources for others |

### Documents Created
- `workspace/shopping-list-immediate.md` — ~$469 total consumables
- `workspace/work-sequence-plan.md` — Full sequence to driving
- `workspace/9-day-task-breakdown.md` — Day-by-day plan with weekend schedule
- `workspace/documentation-deep-dive.md` — Session findings summary

### Database Updates
- Engine updated to P7100 in vehicles table
- Multiple part numbers and costs added
- Now 87 parts with part numbers, 143 with costs

### 9-Day Plan Summary (Driving by Feb 9)
**Weekdays:** Battery recovery, small tasks (carpet, staging parts)
**Weekend:**
- Friday: Oil drain, remove old steering box, battery connectors
- Saturday: Full steering install (box, pump, hoses, bleed, upper steering)
- Sunday: Valve adjustment (if time), dash, seats, first start

### Steering Wheel Stack Explained
Column → Clockspring → Adapter (A17) → Wheel → Airbag Module
- Clockspring centering: Full CW, then 2.5 turns CCW
- Airbag screws: 80-100 IN-LBS (not ft-lbs!)
- 2-minute wait after battery disconnect

### Full Aux Electrical Deferred
- Needs alternator upgrade (162A peak vs 136A factory)
- Staged approach: Wire now, hookup after alternator
- Not blocking driving

---

## 4WD Bypass + Driveline Upgrade Plan

**Problem:** Vacuum-actuated CAD engaging randomly (29-year-old components)

**Solution documented in:** `procedures/09_4wd-vacuum-bypass-driveline-upgrade.md`

**Three phases:**
1. **Bypass** ($0) — Move C-clip to lock front axle engaged, delete vacuum system
2. **Driveshaft** ($700) — Tom Woods 1350 CV, handles 4" lift angles
3. **U-joints** ($80) — Spicer SPL55-3X greaseable, both axle shafts

**Total:** ~$780

**Related future work:**
- 4.56 regear ($1,500-2,000)
- 35" tires ($1,200-1,600)

**Key insight:** With bypass, front driveshaft spins constantly (wheels drive it through diff even in 2H). Upgraded CV driveshaft handles steep angles from lift.

**Timeline:** After steering project complete

---

## Shopping Cart Review

Cody's Amazon cart reviewed. Separated into:
- **Now:** PS fluid, feeler gauge, Loctite, coolant, flush, drain washers, barring tool (~$188)
- **Garage basics:** Fast Orange, spray bottles, wire wheel, floor mat (~$73)
- **Defer (P7100 tools):** Delivery valve socket, gear puller, injector tools, compression tester (~$181)

Barring tool IS useful for valve adjustment — lets you rotate engine to position cylinders properly.

### Archived (completed/obsolete)
- Feb 9 specific planning docs (superseded by 9-day-task-breakdown.md)
- Initial research phase docs (clockspring, Forever Sharp, SRS wiring)
- ETB pump expert doc (vehicle has P7100, not ETB)

### Active Documents
- `9-day-task-breakdown.md` — current plan through Feb 9
- `CONSOLIDATED-REFERENCE.md` — complete vehicle reference (P7100 corrected)
- `shopping-list-immediate.md` — current needs
- `work-sequence-plan.md` — detailed sequence
- `install-docs/` & `research/` — reference libraries

### Documentation Corrections
- **TOOLS.md:** Updated engine spec from ETB to P7100
- **CONSOLIDATED-REFERENCE.md:** Updated pump type
- **Created:** `workspace/README.md` explaining structure

**Result:** Clean, organized workspace with clear active vs archive separation

## Perplexity Verification Session

**Tool:** `pplx` (Perplexity search via shared tooling)
**Total cost:** ~$0.20

### ✅ Verified Specs (Match Our Docs)
| Spec | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Pitman arm nut (RedHead 2869-3T) | 185 ft-lbs | RedHead torque chart |
| Drag link to pitman | 65 ft-lbs + cotter pin | Industry standard |
| Valve lash intake | 0.010" cold | Cummins 6BT spec |
| Valve lash exhaust | 0.020" cold | Cummins 6BT spec |
| Engine oil capacity | 12 qt w/filter | Cummins spec |
| Seat bolts | 30-35 ft-lbs | Common practice |
| PS pump to block | 57 ft-lbs | Borgeson PDF |
| PS pump bracket nut | 18 ft-lbs | Borgeson PDF |

### ⚠️ DISCREPANCY FOUND
| Spec | Our Doc | Perplexity | Action |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| Steering box to frame | 95 ft-lbs | 130-145 ft-lbs | CALL REDHEAD |

Multiple sources returned 130-145 ft-lbs. Our 95 ft-lbs may be incorrect.
**Action:** Call RedHead tech support before Saturday install.

### By Feel (No Specific Torque)
- PS hose fittings: Snug + 1/8-1/4 turn
- Borgeson shaft pinch bolts: 15-25 ft-lbs, recheck at 100 mi

### Oil Filter
- LF16035 (Stratapore) and LF3349 both valid for 5.9L 12-valve

---

## New Tooling Discovered

**Metis mounts working:**
- `/mnt/metis/downloads/` — Cody's laptop Downloads
- `/mnt/metis/documents/` — Cody's laptop Documents

**Shared tools available:**
- `pplx` — Perplexity search with citations (~$0.01-0.04/query)
- `metis` — SSH helper for Metis laptop
- `memory-router` — Federated memory search
- `bb` — Blackboard for cross-agent coordination
- `facts` — Structured facts management

**Infrastructure:** worker-node ↔ Metis ↔ NAS all connected

---

## Perplexity Usage Note

**Cody confirms:** Perplexity is free — use liberally for verification.

**New workflow:** Before stating any spec, torque, procedure, or part compatibility:
1. Check local docs first
2. `pplx` verify if any uncertainty
3. Cite both sources in response

No cost concern — verify everything.

## Investment Clarification

**Your documented purchases (with dates):** ~$9,000
**Undated costs (mix of yours + inherited):** ~$11,000
**Realistic your money:** ~$15-20K
**Previous owner contribution:** ~$15-20K (suspension, bumper, KDP, etc.)

## Phases Revised — Maximize What's On Hand

Created `workspace/AKRON-PHASES-REVISED.md` with logical approach:

| Phase | Focus | Spend | Labor |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Get driving | ~$300 | DIY |
| 2 | Install $8k+ in owned parts | ~$300 | DIY |
| 3 | Critical upgrades (alternator, track bar) | ~$2,300 | DIY |
| 4 | 4WD/driveline | ~$1,400 | DIY |
| 5 | Regear + NV5600 | ~$8-12K | **PRO** |
| 6 | Comfort/protection | Ongoing | Mix |

**Key insight:** Phases 1-4 are almost all labor — installing what's already purchased. Phase 5 is where the pros come in for gears and trans swap.

**Total new spend through Phase 4:** ~$4,300
**Then save for Phase 5 (pro work)**

---

## Final Documentation Updates

**Core docs updated:**
- `00_master-vehicle-record.md` — Added complete Build Vision section
- `TOOLS.md` — Updated with verified specs, pplx workflow
- `workspace/AKRON-PHASES-REVISED.md` — Logical build phases

**Key numbers confirmed:**
- Purchase price: $12,000
- Previous owner upgrades: ~$15-20K
- Your purchases: ~$15-20K  
- Current value: ~$42-52K
- Completion value: ~$54-69K

**Glass/film status:** Longer-term plans, nothing purchased yet
- Acoustic glass: ~$800-1,200 (planned, Phase 6)
- Ceramic window film: ~$400-600 (planned, Phase 6)

**Session complete — all documentation current.**

---

## Tire Recommendation

**"The very best" for puncture resistance:**
**Goodyear Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar** — 35x12.50R17 Load Range E

- Kevlar-reinforced sidewalls (real Kevlar, not marketing)
- 3-ply polyester + 2 steel belt construction
- Military/oilfield standard for puncture resistance
- ~$2,000-2,250 for 5 tires

**Alternative:** BFG KO2 if highway comfort > absolute puncture resistance

**Pairing:** Do tires + 4.56 gears together (~$4,500-5,500 total)

## Workspace Cleanup

**Archived 9 files** (superseded docs)
**Kept 3 main files:**
- AKRON-PHASES-REVISED.md (current phases)
- shopping-list-immediate.md (weekend)
- README.md (navigation)

**Research library:** 16 expert docs preserved as reference

---

## Additional Details (Cody Clarification)

**Transmission:** 46RE was REBUILT — not original 307K unit. More capable than assumed.

**Electrical:** Using MARINE wiring standard for all new circuits:
- Star ground (single reference point)
- Shielded wire (RFI/EMI protection for radio equipment)
- Tinned copper (corrosion resistance)
- ABYC-style standards

**Approach:** New circuits get marine treatment, existing harnesses stay until they cause problems. Pragmatic — not rewiring functional systems unnecessarily.

This explains the Blue Sea fuse block choice — marine-grade distribution for the aux power system.

---

## Final Session Notes

### Key Realizations
1. **$12K purchase for ~$27-32K truck** — Previous owner did Thuren suspension, 4th-gen conversion, KDP, cooling system, B&W gooseneck
2. **Trans was rebuilt** — Not a ticking clock, NV5600 becomes "want" not "need"
3. **Marine wiring standard** — Star ground, shielded, tinned copper for all new circuits
4. **~$8K in parts in boxes** — Phases 1-2 are labor, not spending

### Tire Decision
**Goodyear Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar** — 35x12.50R17 LRE
- Kevlar-reinforced sidewalls (actual puncture resistance)
- Military/oilfield standard
- ~$2,000-2,250 for 5
- Do with 4.56 regear (~$4,500-5,500 total)

### Photo Documentation
172 photos in `/dianoia/autarkeia/praxis/vehicle/dodge_ram_2500_1997/photos/`
- Organized by project phase (8 folders)
- Photo index at PHOTO_INDEX.md

### Workspace Cleanup Done
- Archived 9 superseded docs
- Main workspace: 3 active files

## Plan Review — Decisions Confirmed

**Context:** "Either I die or the truck dies" — lifetime ownership, not a monetary investment.

### Challenged and Confirmed:

| Item | Initial Concern | Cody's Rationale | Decision |
|------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| **370A Alternator** | Overkill for 100Ah | Future: 200Ah+, solar on cab roof | ✅ Keep 370A |
| **4.56 Gears** | 4.10 more efficient | Wants the feel, ~$250/yr fuel is acceptable | ✅ Keep 4.56 |
| **Acoustic Glass** | Skip | Do with ceramic tint when windshield needs replacement | ✅ Keep (triggered) |
| **NV5600** | Defer indefinitely | Final form, lifetime ownership, manual = soul | ✅ Keep (defer install) |
| **CAT Filter** | Keep | Alt fuels capability (WVO, biodiesel, heating oil) | ✅ Keep |

### Key Insight:
Build philosophy is "lifetime partnership" not "optimize for today." All decisions should be evaluated against 20-30 year horizon, not immediate ROI.

### Unchanged from original plan:
- Thuren track bar ($575) — correct choice
- Tom Woods CV driveshaft ($700) — correct choice  
- MT/R Kevlar tires — correct choice
- Iron Cross HD bumpers — correct choice
- VIAIR 400P compressor — correct choice

## Bed Configuration Decision

**Option 3 selected:** Stock + Spare Tire Aux + Jerry Cans

| Component | Spec | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Titan STAFS aux tank | 30 gal, spare tire well | ~$1,200 |
| Wilco Hitchgate Solo | Swing-away 35" spare | ~$800 |
| UWS 69" Low Profile Toolbox | Crossover, gooseneck clearance | ~$600 |
| Jerry can rail mounts | 2x Wavian | ~$75 |
| **Total** | | **~$2,675** |

**Total Fuel Capacity:** 75 gallons (35 stock + 30 STAFS + 10 jerry cans)
**Range:** ~1,050-1,275 miles

**Why this config:**
- Bed stays 100% clear for gooseneck
- Max underbody fuel (65 gal permanent)
- Spare on swing-away (doesn't use bed space)
- Toolbox for recovery/tools/future 2nd battery
- Jerry cans for backup/transfers

**Timing:** Phase 6 (but infrastructure that enables capability)

## Also Learned

**Timing gears:** 12-valve Cummins uses timing GEARS (not chain/belt) - already the most reliable setup, nothing to convert.

**Previous owner towed 26k lbs** routinely - truck is proven capable.

---

## Performance/Reliability Additions (Confirmed)

### Power Target: ~280-320 HP
**Philosophy:** Reliable and capable, healthy balance. Overbuild what's stressed.

### What's Stressed at This Power:
1. **46RE transmission** — Aux cooler mandatory
2. **Fuel delivery** — Lift pump upgrade needed
3. **EGT management** — Exhaust helps

### Additions to Build:

| Item | Spec | Cost | Phase |
|------|------|------|-------|
| **Mishimoto trans cooler** | Stacked-plate, series install | ~$175 | Phase 2 |
| **AirDog 150 4G lift pump** | A4SPBD337 for 94-98 Cummins | ~$625 | Phase 3 |
| **Stainless injector lines** | Industrial Injection or DAP | ~$200 | Phase 2 |
| **Custom exhaust** | 4" stainless Y + manual cable valve | ~$500-600 | Phase 3 |
| **ARB Safari snorkel** | Universal, adapted to fit | ~$500 | Phase 3 |
| **S&B cold air intake** | 75-5090, sealed airbox | ~$375 | Phase 2/3 |

### BIFL Decisions:
- **Exhaust valve:** Custom stainless fab with cable-operated manual valve (no electronics)
- **Air intake:** ARB Safari snorkel → S&B sealed airbox (not ram air scoop)
- **Reasoning:** Both are "do once, never touch again" solutions

### Why Not Ram Air:
- Turbo does the pressurizing, not forward motion
- Ram air scoop is cosmetic on diesel
- Snorkel actually protects engine from water/dust

**Total new additions:** ~$2,375-2,475

---

## Exhaust System (Cody Clarification)

**Current setup:**
- Straight piped (no muffler)
- Bigger than stock (likely 4"+)
- Stainless steel
- "Goes up then down" — turndown tip or stack style
- Brand: Unknown (photos exist, check later)

**Implication:** Starting point is already upgraded. For switchable exhaust, shop just needs to:
1. Add Y-pipe split after turbo
2. Install manual cable valve
3. Route one leg through muffler

**Documentation gap:** Need to verify exact diameter and brand from photos.

---

## Final Session Notes (Evening)

### Timing System
- 12-valve Cummins uses **timing GEARS** (not chain or belt)
- This is the most reliable setup — nothing to convert
- Gears don't stretch or wear like chains/belts

### Previous Owner Towing
- Claimed **26k lbs routinely** with no issues
- Speaks to truck capability with Dana 70-2U + B&W gooseneck

### Exhaust System (Confirmed by Cody)
- **Current:** Straight piped, stainless, bigger than stock
- **Style:** "Goes up then down" — turndown tip or stack
- **Brand:** Unknown (photos exist, not in documentation folders yet)
- **Implication:** Already upgraded — valve install is simpler

### Photo Search Results
- Searched 172 photos for exhaust
- Found one side-angle showing black-coated tip, side-exit
- No brand markings visible
- Cody has exhaust photos but not in organized folders

### Session Duration
- Extended session (~4+ hours)
- Major documentation, planning, and decision-making
- Build vision now comprehensive with all systems planned

## Exhaust Brand Identified

**Brand:** Diamond Eye Performance
**Material:** T409 stainless steel
**Size:** 4" (likely — bigger than stock)
**Type:** Turbo-back, straight-piped (no muffler)
**Exit:** Side exit with turndown
**Construction:** Mandrel-bent

**Quality:** Diamond Eye is a reputable diesel exhaust brand — this is already BIFL-quality stainless. No need to replace the existing pipe for the switchable setup, just add:
- Y-pipe splice
- Manual cable valve
- Muffler leg for quiet mode

**Estimated valve addition cost:** ~$400-500 (down from $600 since base pipe exists)

*Confirmed by Cody 2026-02-03 18:54 CST*

## Exhaust Photo Confirmed

**Photo saved:** `photos/02_initial_condition/exhaust_diamond_eye_turndown.jpg`

**Visual confirmation:**
- Diamond Eye Performance embossed on turndown tip
- 4" stainless steel
- Turndown style (180° bend, exits toward ground)
- Mandrel-bent construction
- Condition: Good (surface discoloration is heat patina, not rust)
- Location: Behind rear axle, under bed

This is quality BIFL exhaust already installed. Valve addition is straightforward.

## Fuse Panel Reference (From Photo)

**Part No:** 55055699 (Chrysler fuse panel cover)

| Position | Amp | Circuit |
|----------|-----|---------|
| F1 | — | — |
| CB1 | 30A | Power Window |
| F2 | 30A | Blower Motor |
| CB2 | 30A | Power Seat |
| 1 | 20A | Power Outlet |
| 5 | 20A | Cigar Light |
| 6 | 20A | Turn Signal |
| 7 | 15A | Radio |
| 8 | 20A | Wiper |
| 9 | 10A | Engine |
| 11 | 10A | Buzzer/Console |
| 12 | 15A | Airbag Cluster |
| **13** | **5A** | **Illum (Illumination)** ← The problem circuit |
| 14 | 20A | RWAL/ABS |
| 15 | 15A | Back Up Lamp |
| 16 | 15A | Airbag |
| 17 | 15A | I.O.D. |
| 18 | 15A | Park Lamp |
| 19 | 20A | Power Door Lock |
| 20 | 20A | Stop Lamp |

**Note:** 10A short issue is on the illumination circuit (position 13).
Fuse is spec'd at 5A but Cody has been testing with 10A fuses that blow instantly.
This confirms SHORT - something is drawing >5A on the illumination circuit.

---

## CORRECTION: Radio Wiring

**The blue bullet connector radio wiring was done by CODY, not the previous owner.**

Cody acknowledges it needs to be redone properly. The 10A illumination short is still suspected to be related to aftermarket wiring behind the dash, but the radio install specifically was Cody's work.
