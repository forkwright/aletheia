# Akron Session — 2026-02-10

## Summary
Major discovery session: truck has FACTORY HYDROBOOST braking, not vacuum booster. Complete PS/hydroboost hose circuit mapped via physical cut-matching. Vacuum line confirmed intact. Previous assumptions about vacuum hose cuts were wrong — all cut lines are PS circuit.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Factory Hydroboost

**The 1997 Ram 2500 Cummins has a HYDRAULIC BRAKE BOOSTER (hydroboost) from the factory.**

FSM Group 5, Brakes → Power Brake Assist → Hydraulic Brake Booster → Description and Operation:
> "Vehicles equipped with the diesel engine use a Hydraulic Booster to supply power assist to the brake system. The booster is mounted to the front cowl panel and the master cylinder is mounted to the booster. The hydraulic pressure is supplied to the booster from the power steering pump."

### What this means:
1. Vacuum pump serves HVAC ONLY — not brakes
2. Brake assist comes from PS pump pressure through the hydroboost unit
3. The $1,877 hydroboost conversion in build plan is NOT NEEDED — already factory equipped
4. The "black box" identified in earlier photos = hydroboost unit on firewall
5. The blue cylindrical component = hydroboost ACCUMULATOR (high-pressure nitrogen gas, WARNING: do not drop on accumulator)
6. Accumulator provides 2-3 emergency brake applications if PS pump fails

### Impact on build plan:
- REMOVE hydroboost conversion line item from brake system overhaul ($1,877 saved)
- Brake system overhaul cost drops from ~$4,815 to ~$2,938
- EGR rear disc conversion, front rebuild, stainless lines, master cylinder, proportioning valve still needed

## Complete PS/Hydroboost Hose Map

### Components
| Name | Location | Ports |
|---|---|---|
| Steering pump (old, removed) | Driveway | 3 ports |
| Hydraulic brake booster (hydroboost) | Firewall, behind master cylinder | 3 ports (2 pressure + 1 return per FSM) |
| Steering gear box (old, removed) | Driveway | 2 ports |
| PS fluid cooler | Radiator support (may be in Run 4) | TBD |

### All 4 Runs — Confirmed by Physical Cut-Matching

| Run | From (a) | To (b) | Function | Hose Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Gear box port 1 (long metal) | Hydroboost right port | Pressure out to gear | ✅ In hand |
| **2** | Pump bottom port (longest metal) | Hydroboost top port | Pressure in from pump | ✅ In hand |
| **3** | Pump top port (hose to metal tip) | Hydroboost 2nd/forward-right port | Booster return to pump | ✅ In hand |
| **4** | Pump middle port (med metal) | Gear box port 2 (short metal) | Gear return to pump | ⚠️ Missing — cut twice months apart |

### Circuit Diagram
```
PRESSURE IN:       Pump bottom → Hydroboost top
PRESSURE OUT:      Hydroboost right → Gear box port 1
RETURN (booster):  Hydroboost 2nd right → Pump top
RETURN (gear box): Gear box port 2 → [cooler?] → Pump middle
HVAC VACUUM:       Vacuum pump → TEE → firewall (INTACT, never cut)
```

## Vacuum System — INTACT
- Vacuum pump has a thin nipple output on its body
- Connects via small hose to a TEE junction at the firewall
- TEE distributes vacuum to HVAC door actuators (defrost/vent/heat mode selection)
- This line was NEVER CUT — completely intact
- Only serves HVAC, not brakes (hydroboost handles brakes)
- Brintek barb splicer kit ordered yesterday NOT needed for vacuum splice (keep for toolbox)

## Key Corrections from This Session
1. **Truck has hydroboost, NOT vacuum booster** — never identified in any prior session
2. **ALL cut hoses are PS circuit lines** — none were vacuum lines
3. **The "black box" = hydroboost**, not the vacuum pump as I initially guessed
4. **Blue cylindrical component = hydroboost accumulator** (high-pressure gas), not vacuum check valve
5. **Mopar 04874538 vacuum hose was never cut** — the HVAC vacuum line is intact
6. **FSM specifies MOPAR PS fluid, NOT ATF** for hydroboost systems — need to verify ATF+4 compatibility

## Methodology Note
Cody drove the correct approach today: systematic physical tracing of each cut hose, matching cut ends, identifying ports BEFORE naming them. His Run 1-4 with a/b endpoint framework was clean and effective. This is exactly what SOUL.md prescribes.

## Open Threads
- [ ] Borgeson 925117 compatibility with hydroboost circuit — 2-hose kit vs 4-line system
- [ ] Run 4 replacement hose needed (gear box return to pump, possibly through cooler)
- [ ] FSM says MOPAR PS fluid not ATF — verify what goes in hydroboost system
- [ ] Hydroboost accumulator snap ring inspection per FSM before reassembly
- [ ] Update build plan: remove hydroboost conversion ($1,877 saved)
- [ ] PS pump install + steering box mount + full reassembly still pending
- [ ] Engine no-idle issue still undiagnosed (FSS voltage check needed)
- [ ] Consumables still to confirm: Loctite 242, cotter pins, anti-seize, coolant
- [ ] O'Reilly loaner torque wrench still needed

## Engine Block Connector Behind PS Pump
- **Identified: Oil pressure sending unit**
- Location: Driver side of block, just behind PS pump
- Source: Diesel Truck Resource Forums — "Look on the side of the block just behind the power steering pump, you'll see it"
- 2-pin electrical connector
- Threaded into a pressurized oil gallery — DO NOT REMOVE (oil everywhere)
- It interfered with pump installation angle — Cody had to remove studs and angle pump past it
- The factory pump cleared it; Borgeson 800328 clears it once fully seated

## End-of-Day Progress
- ✅ Factory hydroboost discovered ($1,877 saved)
- ✅ Complete 4-run PS hose circuit mapped and documented
- ✅ Vacuum line confirmed intact (never cut)
- ✅ Borgeson 800328 PS pump mounted onto vacuum pump
- Studs not yet torqued — pump seated but needs final bolt-up
- Next: finish pump bolt-up → gear box mount → shaft → hoses → pitman arm + drag link
