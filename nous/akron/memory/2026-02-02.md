# Akron Memory — 2026-02-02 (Monday)

## Session: Initial Setup & Steering Project Planning

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Deadline Confirmed:** Truck must be driving by **Sunday Feb 9**
   - Work window: Friday Feb 7 - Sunday Feb 9
   - ~8-9 hours of work estimated

2. **SRS/Airbag Status:** COMPLETELY REMOVED
   - No airbags anywhere in vehicle
   - No SRS module
   - Forever Sharp wheel has no airbag
   - This eliminates: airbag module install, inch-pound torque wrench, capacitor discharge wait, airbag light test

3. **Clockspring Decision:** INSTALL IT
   - Sintech Auto 56007605/56007627AA
   - Needed for future cruise control relocation
   - Must be centered: 2.5 turns counterclockwise from full CW
   - Cruise control switches were on stock wheel, will be relocated elsewhere later

4. **Interior Status:** Dash completely out
   - LRB Speed aluminum dash not yet installed
   - No instrument cluster
   - No gauges during test drive — use phone for speed, short drives for safety

### Current Physical State of Truck

- Old steering box: 1 bolt remaining
- Pitman arm: OFF old box, hanging on drag link
- PS lines: CUT (Borgeson system replacing entirely)
- Old PS pump: Still installed, coming out
- Interior: Stripped, no dash

### Parts Verified On Hand

All steering parts confirmed in database:
- RedHead Steering Gear 2869-3T
- Borgeson PS Pump 800328
- Borgeson PS Hoses 925117
- Borgeson Telescoping Shaft 000950
- Skyjacker FA400 Pitman Arm
- Sintech Auto Clockspring
- Forever Sharp 15" Black Empire wheel
- Forever Sharp A17 adapter (6-hole)

### Consumables Needed (~$115)

- Valvoline SynPower PS Fluid (4 qt) — $40
- Loctite 242 Blue — $8
- Anti-seize compound — $10
- NEW castle nut (pitman arm) — $5
- NEW cotter pin — $1
- Brake cleaner — $16
- Degreaser — $15
- NEW steering wheel nut (if not included with adapter) — verify

### Critical Torque Specs

| Component | Torque | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Steering box to frame | **95 ft-lbs** | Crisscross: 40→70→95, through PRP brace |
| Pitman arm nut | **185 ft-lbs** | Progressive: 50→100→150→185 (NOT 225) |
| Steering shaft pinch bolts | **36 ft-lbs** | Loctite 242 on threads |
| PS pump to engine | **57 ft-lbs** | |
| PS hose at pump | **22 ft-lbs** | |
| PS hose at box | **23 ft-lbs** | |
| Steering wheel nut | **45 ft-lbs** | |

### Critical Notes

1. **PRP Steering Box Support Brace (EL205)** already installed by previous owner — bolt RedHead through it
2. **Pitman arm torque discrepancy:** Torque spec file says 225 ft-lbs, procedure says 185 ft-lbs — USE 185 (service manual spec)
3. **RedHead break-in:** Do NOT go full lock-to-lock for first 200 miles
4. **A17 adapter:** Confirmed compatible with Borgeson 000950 shaft (3/4" 30-spline)

- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/akron/workspace/akron-no-srs-wiring.md`

### Next Actions

1. **This week (Mon-Thu):** Acquire consumables
2. **Friday Feb 7:** Begin steering work
3. **Sat-Sun Feb 8-9:** Complete steering, test drive

### Not Doing This Sprint

- Cruise control switch relocation (later)
- Dash installation (separate project)
- 10A illumination short diagnosis (doesn't prevent driving)

## P7100 Pump Confirmed

**2026-02-03:** Visual inspection confirms P7100 inline injection pump, NOT ETB/VE as previously documented. All planned mods (fuel plate, governor springs, injectors) are compatible.
