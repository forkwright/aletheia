# Academic Research on Infant Cry-it-Out/Extinction-Based Sleep Training
## Comprehensive Literature Review

*Compiled: February 8, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This compilation examines academic literature on infant extinction-based sleep training (commonly called "cry-it-out" methods) across several critical areas: physiological stress responses (cortisol), attachment security, infant self-regulation development, objective vs. subjective sleep measurements, and cross-cultural perspectives.

## 1. INFANT CORTISOL LEVELS AND STRESS RESPONSES DURING SLEEP TRAINING

### Key Study: Middlemiss et al. (2011) - Cortisol Asynchrony Study

**Citation:** Middlemiss, W., Granger, D.A., Goldberg, W.A., & Nathans, L. (2011). Asynchrony of mother–infant hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity following extinction of infant crying responses induced during the transition to sleep. *Early Human Development*, 88(4), 227-232.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2011.08.010

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Discovery:** This study found that while extinction-based sleep training reduced infant crying behaviors, cortisol levels remained elevated in infants even after they stopped crying
- **Maternal-Infant Asynchrony:** Mothers' cortisol levels decreased as their infants' crying diminished, but infants' cortisol remained high, creating a problematic disconnect
- **Clinical Significance:** The persistence of elevated stress hormones despite behavioral quieting suggests that extinction methods may suppress external distress signals without addressing internal stress

**Study Design:** Longitudinal study examining cortisol patterns in mother-infant dyads during sleep training implementation

## 2. SLEEP TRAINING EFFICACY AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS

### Mindell et al. (2006) - Comprehensive Review of Behavioral Sleep Treatments

**Citation:** Mindell, J.A., Kuhn, B.R., Lewin, D.S., Meltzer, L.J., & Sadeh, A. (2006). Behavioral treatment of bedtime problems and night wakings in infants and young children. *Sleep*, 29(10), 1263-1276.

**DOI:** 10.1093/sleep/29.10.1263

**Key Findings:**
- Review of 52 treatment studies on behavioral sleep interventions
- Extinction-based methods show short-term efficacy for reducing night wakings and bedtime resistance
- However, this review preceded the cortisol research and focused primarily on behavioral outcomes

### American Academy of Sleep Medicine Practice Parameters

**Citation:** Morgenthaler, T.I., Owens, J., Alessi, C., et al. (2006). Practice parameters for behavioral treatment of bedtime problems and night wakings in infants and young children. *Sleep*, 29(10), 1277-1281.

**DOI:** 10.1093/sleep/29.10.1277

**Key Findings:**
- Established clinical practice guidelines
- Focused on effectiveness for behavioral outcomes
- Limited consideration of long-term physiological or attachment effects

## 3. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENT VS. PARENT REPORTS

### Sadeh (1996) - Actigraphy vs. Parental Reports Study

**Citation:** Sadeh, A. (1996). Evaluating night wakings in sleep-disturbed infants: A methodological study of parental reports and actigraphy. *Sleep*, 19(10), 757-762.

**DOI:** 10.1093/sleep/19.10.757

**Key Findings:**
- **Methodological Concerns:** Significant discrepancies between objective actigraphy measurements and parental reports of infant sleep
- **Clinical Implications:** Parental reports may overestimate sleep improvements following interventions
- **Research Quality Issues:** Many sleep training studies rely heavily on subjective parental reports rather than objective measures

### Ancoli-Israel et al. (2003) - Actigraphy Standards Review

**Citation:** Ancoli-Israel, S., Cole, R., Alessi, C., et al. (2003). The role of actigraphy in the study of sleep and circadian rhythms. *Sleep*, 26(3), 342-392.

**DOI:** 10.1093/sleep/26.3.342

**Key Findings:**
- Actigraphy provides more reliable continuous sleep data than sleep logs
- Important for validating sleep intervention outcomes
- Highlights limitations of studies relying solely on parent reports

## 4. ATTACHMENT SECURITY AND RESPONSIVE CAREGIVING

### van den Boom (1994) - Sensitive Responsiveness and Attachment

**Citation:** van den Boom, D.C. (1994). The influence of temperament and mothering on attachment and exploration: an experimental manipulation of sensitive responsiveness among lower-class mothers with irritable infants. *Child Development*, 65(6), 1457-1477.

**DOI:** 10.2307/1131511

**Key Findings:**
- Demonstrated that increasing maternal sensitive responsiveness improves attachment security
- Particularly relevant for understanding how sleep training approaches may impact caregiver responsiveness

**Attachment Theory Implications:**
- Extinction-based methods fundamentally conflict with responsive caregiving principles
- May disrupt the development of secure attachment relationships

## 5. INFANT SELF-REGULATION AND CO-REGULATION

### Crockenberg & Leerkes (2004) - Infant Self-Regulation Development

**Citation:** Crockenberg, S., & Leerkes, E.M. (2004). Infant and maternal behaviors regulate infant reactivity to novelty at 6 months. *Developmental Psychology*, 40(6), 1123-1132.

**DOI:** 10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1123

**Key Findings:**
- Infant self-regulation develops through co-regulatory interactions with caregivers
- Maternal regulatory behaviors are crucial for infant emotional regulation development
- **Implications:** Extinction methods may bypass necessary co-regulatory processes

### McGowan & Delafield-Butt (2022) - Narrative as Co-regulation

**Citation:** McGowan, T., & Delafield-Butt, J. (2022). Narrative as co-regulation: A review of embodied narrative in infant development. *Infant Behavior and Development*, 68, 101747.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.infbeh.2022.101747

**Key Findings:**
- Co-regulation between caregiver and infant is fundamental to healthy development
- Embodied narrative interactions support emotional and physiological regulation

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jpeds.2023.01.011

**Key Findings:**
- Recent review acknowledging need for more nuanced, evidence-based approach
- Recognition of gaps in long-term safety research

## 7. CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES

### Ball (2013) - Cultural Context of Infant Sleep

**Citation:** Ball, H.L. (2013). Supporting parents who are worried about their newborn's sleep. *BMJ*, 347, f2344.

**DOI:** 10.1136/bmj.f2344

**Key Findings:**
- Western sleep training approaches are not universal
- Many cultures prioritize responsive nighttime caregiving
- Need to reframe expectations of "normal" infant sleep

---

## RESEARCH GAPS AND LIMITATIONS

### Major Concerns Identified:

1. **Cortisol Persistence**: The Middlemiss study reveals that behavioral extinction may mask continued physiological stress
2. **Methodological Issues**: Over-reliance on parental reports vs. objective measures
3. **Long-term Studies Lacking**: Limited research on long-term attachment and developmental outcomes
4. **Cultural Bias**: Research predominantly from Western, individualistic cultures
5. **Recent Safety Research**: Limited 2024-2026 research specifically addressing safety concerns

### Key Questions Requiring Further Research:

- Long-term attachment security outcomes following extinction-based sleep training
- Developmental impacts of early cortisol dysregulation from sleep training
- Cultural variations in sleep training effectiveness and acceptability
- Optimal age and developmental readiness for any behavioral sleep interventions

---

## CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Based on this literature review:

1. **Physiological Stress Concerns**: Evidence suggests extinction methods may cause sustained stress even when behavioral symptoms resolve
2. **Attachment Considerations**: Sleep training approaches should be evaluated for compatibility with responsive caregiving
3. **Measurement Validity**: Studies should include objective sleep measures, not just parental reports
4. **Individualized Approaches**: Cultural background, temperament, and developmental readiness should inform decisions
5. **Long-term Monitoring**: Need for research tracking developmental outcomes beyond immediate behavioral changes
