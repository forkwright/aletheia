## THE TRIGGERING EVENT: 2025 Sleep Health Commentary

### Lecuelle et al. (2025) — The Paper Everyone's Talking About
- **Title:** "Should you let your baby cry at night? The 'no' rumor persists, despite insufficient scientific evidence with cortisol-stress measures"
- **Journal:** Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation, 11(2), 127-130
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.sleh.2025.01.001
- **PMID:** 40021382
- **Authors:** Florian Lecuelle, Marie-Josèphe Challamel, Michal Kahn, Jodi A. Mindell, Oliviero Bruni
- **Type:** Commentary/Opinion piece (NOT original research)
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Dr. Bruni reports personal fees from Neurim; Dr. Mindell reports grant and personal fees from Kenvue Brands, LLC
- **Claims:** 
  - CIO is safe based on 30+ years of research
  - Critics rely on "two flawed studies" (Middlemiss 2012, 2017)
  - Two "better" studies (Blunden 2022, Gradisar 2016) show no cortisol elevation
  - Temporary stress is "necessary" for development
- **Critical Issues:**
  - Authors are behavioral sleep researchers whose careers are built on these methods
  - "No evidence of harm" ≠ "evidence of no harm"
  - Small, short-term, clinic-based studies used as counter-evidence
  - No new data — just a reframing of existing literature

## PART 1: THE CORE CORTISOL STUDIES

### 1A. Middlemiss et al. (2012) — THE KEY STUDY
- **Title:** "Asynchrony of mother–infant hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity following extinction of infant crying responses induced during the transition to sleep"
- **Journal:** Early Human Development, 88(4), 227-232
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2011.08.010
- **Cited by:** 81
- **Authors:** Wendy Middlemiss, Douglas A. Granger, Wendy A. Goldberg, Laura Nathans

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
- By Day 3 of CIO sleep training, infants stopped crying
- Mothers' cortisol levels dropped (they believed babies were fine)
- **Infants' cortisol levels REMAINED ELEVATED** despite no longer crying
- Created a dangerous mother-infant HPA axis asynchrony
- The baby stopped signaling. The baby did NOT stop being stressed.
- Behavioral extinction suppressed the communication, not the distress

### 1B. Middlemiss et al. (2017) — Follow-up: Response-Based Alternative
- **Title:** "Response-based sleep intervention: Helping infants sleep without making them cry"
- **Journal:** Early Human Development, 110, 35-41
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2017.03.008
- **Cited by:** 16
- **Authors:** Wendy Middlemiss, Helen Stevens, Lael Ridgway, Susan McDonald, Michelle Koussa

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Demonstrated that responsive sleep interventions (NOT extinction-based) can help infants sleep
- Did not require ignoring infant crying
- Maintained mother-infant cortisol synchrony
- Shows there ARE alternatives that work without the stress risks

## PART 2: THE PRO-CIO STUDIES (AND THEIR LIMITATIONS)

### 2A. Gradisar et al. (2016) — Frequently cited as "CIO is safe"
- **Title:** "Behavioral Interventions for Infant Sleep Problems: A Randomized Controlled Trial"
- **Journal:** Pediatrics, 137(6)
- **DOI:** 10.1542/peds.2015-1486
- **Cited by:** 115 (originally 127)
- **Authors:** Michael Gradisar, Kate Jackson, Nicola J. Spurrier, Joyce Gibson, Justine Whitham

**What it claims:** Graduated extinction and bedtime fading showed no adverse stress responses (cortisol), no differences in attachment, no long-term emotional/behavioral problems at 12 months.

**Critical limitations:**
- Small sample size (43 infants total across 3 groups)
- Cortisol measured only at limited timepoints — not during the actual crying nights
- Short follow-up (12 months)
- Attachment measured via parent report, not Strange Situation or objective measure
- Clinic-based sample — not generalizable

### 2B. Price et al. (2012) — 5-Year Follow-up
- **Title:** "Five-Year Follow-up of Harms and Benefits of Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention: Randomized Trial"
- **Journal:** Pediatrics, 130(4), 643-651
- **DOI:** 10.1542/peds.2011-3467
- **Cited by:** 111 (originally 122)
- **Authors:** Anna M.H. Price, Melissa Wake, Obioha C. Ukoumunne, Harriet Hiscock

**What it claims:** No long-term harms at 5-year follow-up on child emotional health, conduct, sleep, stress, or parent-child relationship.

**Critical limitations:**
- High attrition rate — many families dropped out
- No objective attachment measures
- Parent-reported outcomes
- No cortisol or physiological measurements at follow-up
- "No evidence of harm" based on lack of measurement, not evidence of safety

### 2C. Bilgin & Wolke (2020) — "No adverse effects at 18 months"
- **Title:** "Parental use of 'cry it out' in infants: no adverse effects on attachment and behavioural development at 18 months"
- **Journal:** Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 61(11), 1184-1193
- **DOI:** 10.1111/jcpp.13223
- **Cited by:** 26
- **Authors:** Ayten Bilgin, Dieter Wolke

**Critical limitations:**
- Parent-reported attachment measures (not Strange Situation)
- Parents who sleep-train and perceive improvement may rate attachment more favorably
- 18-month follow-up is relatively short for attachment outcomes
- Naturalistic/observational design — no controlled conditions

## PART 3: STUDIES CHALLENGING THE CIO PARADIGM

### 3A. Blunden et al. (2011) — Challenging the Status Quo
- **Title:** "Behavioural sleep treatments and night time crying in infants: Challenging the status quo"
- **Journal:** Sleep Medicine Reviews, 15(5), 327-334
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.smrv.2010.11.002
- **Cited by:** 84
- **Authors:** Sarah L. Blunden, Kirrilly R. Thompson, Drew Dawson

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Systematic critique of the evidence base for extinction-based sleep training
- Found that most pro-CIO studies have significant methodological weaknesses
- Noted reliance on parent-reported outcomes rather than objective measures
- Called attention to the gap between behavioral outcomes and physiological measures

### 3B. Blunden et al. (2022) — Responsive vs. Extinction
- **Title:** "Do responsive sleep interventions impact mental health in mother/infant dyads compared to extinction interventions? A pilot study"
- **Journal:** Archives of Women's Mental Health, 25, 621-631
- **DOI:** 10.1007/s00737-022-01224-w
- **Cited by:** 9 (originally 8)
- **Authors:** Sarah Blunden, Joanne Osborne, Yaroslava King

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Compared responsive sleep interventions to extinction-based methods
- Responsive interventions showed comparable or better outcomes for maternal mental health
- Suggests alternatives to CIO are viable and may be preferable
- Important because the 2025 commentary paper cites this study favorably — but misrepresents its conclusions

### 3C. ABM Clinical Protocol #37 (2023)
- **Title:** "ABM Clinical Protocol #37: Physiological Infant Care—Managing Nighttime Breastfeeding in Young Infants"
- **Journal:** Breastfeeding Medicine, 18(7), 497-520
- **DOI:** 10.1089/bfm.2023.29236.abm
- **Cited by:** 19
- **Authors:** Deena Zimmerman, Melissa Bartick, Lori Feldman-Winter, Helen L. Ball

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine official clinical protocol
- Recommends AGAINST extinction-based sleep training for breastfeeding infants
- Night feeds are biologically normal and important for milk supply and infant nutrition
- CIO methods negatively impact breastfeeding relationship and duration
- Infant sleep patterns should be understood in context of breastfeeding biology

## PART 4: OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENT EVIDENCE

### 4A. Sadeh (1996) — Parent Reports vs. Reality
- **Title:** "Evaluating night wakings in sleep-disturbed infants: A methodological study of parental reports and actigraphy"
- **Journal:** Sleep, 19(10), 757-762
- **DOI:** 10.1093/sleep/19.10.757

**KEY FINDING:** Significant discrepancies between what parents report and what actigraphy (objective measurement) shows. Parents overestimate sleep improvements after interventions. Many "successes" of CIO are babies who stopped signaling, not babies who stopped waking.

### Key Insight from the Danish Review:
With objective measurements (actigraphy, video), CIO sleep training shows:
- **NO improvement in number of night wakings**
- **NO improvement in total sleep amount**
- The ONLY change: babies stop signaling/crying → parents report "better sleep"

### 5A. Bowlby (1969) — Attachment Theory
- **Title:** Attachment and Loss, Vol. 1: Attachment
- **Cited by:** 15,515
- Key principle: Attachment behaviors are evolutionary survival mechanisms; consistent responsive care creates secure attachment

### 5B. de Wolff & van IJzendoorn (1997) — Meta-Analysis on Sensitivity
- **Title:** "Sensitivity and Attachment: A Meta-Analysis on Parental Antecedents of Infant Attachment"
- **Journal:** Child Development, 68(4), 571-591

- **DOI:** 10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1123
- **Cited by:** 218
- **KEY FINDING:** Infant self-regulation develops through co-regulation with caregivers. Maternal regulatory behaviors are crucial. Premature demands for self-soothing bypass necessary developmental processes.

### 5J. Narvaez et al. (2013, 2016) — Evolved Developmental Niche
- **2013:** "The evolved developmental niche and child sociomoral outcomes in Chinese 3-year-olds" — European Journal of Developmental Psychology — DOI: 10.1080/17405629.2012.761606 — 44 cites

## PART 6: THE DANISH PSYCHOLOGISTS' LETTER (2019)

### 723 Danish Psychologists' Open Letter
- **Date:** August 19, 2019
- **Signatories:** 723+ licensed psychologists
- **Target:** Gyldendal Publishers, re: "Godnat og sov godt" (sleep training book)
- **Original source:** soevnvejledning.dk

**Key arguments:**
1. Crying is communication, not manipulation — it signals a need
2. Babies/toddlers CANNOT self-soothe — they depend on caregiver co-regulation
3. Sensitive response to crying is THE most important factor in secure attachment
4. Secure attachment is foundational for healthy development and resilience
5. Ignoring crying periodically MAY RISK DAMAGING attachment
6. Objective sleep measurements show NO positive effect of CIO on actual sleep
7. Few studies claiming CIO is safe used objective attachment measures
8. CIO increases SIDS risk (solitary sleeping under 1 year)
9. CIO undermines breastfeeding

**Outcome:** Denmark's health authorities moved away from recommending CIO methods.

## SUMMARY: THE EVIDENCE MAP

### What the evidence SHOWS:
1. **Cortisol stays elevated** in babies after CIO even when crying stops (Middlemiss 2012)
2. **Maternal sensitivity predicts attachment** across 66 studies, N=4,176 (de Wolff & van IJzendoorn 1997)
3. **Self-regulation develops through co-regulation** — not isolation (Crockenberg 2004, Schore 2001)
4. **Objective sleep measures show NO improvement** from CIO — only parent-reported "improvement" (Sadeh 1996, Danish review)
5. **CIO undermines breastfeeding** (ABM Clinical Protocol 2023)
6. **Early stress affects brain development** (Schore 2001, Rincón-Cortés 2014, Jansen 2009)
7. **Responsive alternatives work** without the risks (Middlemiss 2017, Blunden 2022)

### What the pro-CIO studies DON'T have:
- Large sample sizes
- Long-term follow-up with objective measures
- Cortisol measurement DURING the actual crying nights
- Objective attachment assessments (Strange Situation)
- Breastfeeding outcome tracking
- Cross-cultural representation

### The fundamental problem:
"No evidence of harm" ≠ "evidence of no harm." The absence of research proving harm is being marketed as proof of safety. The baby stops crying. The baby doesn't stop needing.
