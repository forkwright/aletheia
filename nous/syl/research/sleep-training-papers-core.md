**Abstract:**
This study examines change in the synchrony between mothers' and infants' physiology as 25 infants (11 males; 4 to 10 months of age) participate in a 5-day inpatient sleep training program in which they learn to self-settle through extinction of crying responses during the transition to sleep. The mothers' and infants' experience during the extinction protocol was "yoked" by the infants' behavioral signaling during the sleep transition period. Saliva was sampled for mothers and infants at initiation of infants' nighttime sleep and following infants' falling to sleep on two program days and later assayed for cortisol. As expected on the first day of the program, mothers' and infants' cortisol levels were positively associated at initiation of nighttime sleep following a day of shared activities. Also, when infants expressed distress in response to the sleep transition, mother and infant cortisol responses were again positively associated. On the third day of the program, however, results showed that infants' physiological and behavioral responses were dissociated. They no longer expressed behavioral distress during the sleep transition but their cortisol levels were elevated. Without the infants' distress cue, mothers' cortisol levels decreased. The dissociation between infants' behavioral and physiological responses resulted in asynchrony in mothers' and infants' cortisol levels. The findings are discussed in relation to understanding the determinants and implications of maternal-infant physiological synchrony in early childhood.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Discovery:** After 3 days of cry-it-out training, infants stopped crying but their cortisol (stress hormone) levels remained elevated
- **Physiological Disconnect:** Behavioral responses (crying) and physiological responses (stress) became dissociated
- **Mother-Infant Asynchrony:** Without crying cues, mothers' stress levels decreased while babies remained physiologically stressed
- **Hidden Stress:** The study suggests babies may appear "trained" behaviorally while remaining internally stressed

## 2. Gradisar et al. (2016) - Behavioral Interventions RCT

**Full Citation:**
Gradisar, Michael, Kate Jackson, Nicola J. Spurrier, Joyce Gibson, Justine Whitham, Anne Sved Williams, Robyn Dolby, and David J. Kennaway. "Behavioral Interventions for Infant Sleep Problems: A Randomized Controlled Trial." Pediatrics 137, no. 6 (2016): e20151486.

**DOI:** 10.1542/peds.2015-1486  
**PMID:** 27221288  
**Citations:** 115 (as of search date)  

**Abstract:**
**Objectives:** To evaluate the effects of behavioral interventions on the sleep/wakefulness of infants, parent and infant stress, and later child emotional/behavioral problems, and parent-child attachment.

**Methods:** A total of 43 infants (6-16 months, 63% girls) were randomized to receive either graduated extinction (n = 14), bedtime fading (n = 15), or sleep education control (n = 14). Sleep measures included parent-reported sleep diaries and infant actigraphy. Infant stress was measured via morning and afternoon salivary cortisol sampling, and mothers' self-reported mood and stress. Twelve months after intervention, mothers completed assessments of children's emotional and behavioral problems, and mother-child dyads underwent the strange situation procedure to evaluate parent-child attachment.

**Results:** Significant interactions were found for sleep latency (P < .05), number of awakenings (P < .0001), and wake after sleep onset (P = .01), with large decreases in sleep latency for graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups, and large decreases in number of awakenings and wake after sleep onset for the graduated extinction group. Salivary cortisol showed small-to-moderate declines in graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups compared with controls. Mothers' stress showed small-to-moderate decreases for the graduated extinction and bedtime fading conditions over the first month, yet no differences in mood were detected. At the 12-month follow-up, no significant differences were found in emotional and behavioral problems, and no significant differences in secure-insecure attachment styles between groups.

**Conclusions:** Both graduated extinction and bedtime fading provide significant sleep benefits above control, yet convey no adverse stress responses or long-term effects on parent-child attachment or child emotions and behavior.

**Key Findings:**
- Sleep training methods (graduated extinction and bedtime fading) improved sleep metrics
- Cortisol levels showed "small-to-moderate declines" (contrasts with Middlemiss findings)
- No long-term attachment or behavioral problems detected at 12-month follow-up
- Study supports safety and efficacy of behavioral sleep interventions

## 3. Price et al. (2012) - Five-Year Follow-Up Study

**Full Citation:**
Price, Anna M.H., Melissa Wake, Obioha C. Ukoumunne, and Harriet Hiscock. "Five-Year Follow-up of Harms and Benefits of Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention: Randomized Trial." Pediatrics 130, no. 4 (2012): 643-651.

**DOI:** 10.1542/peds.2011-3467  
**PMID:** 22966034  
**Citations:** 111 (as of search date)  

**Abstract:**
**Background and objectives:** Randomized trials have demonstrated the short- to medium-term effectiveness of behavioral infant sleep interventions. However, concerns persist that they may harm children's emotional development and subsequent mental health. This study aimed to determine long-term harms and/or benefits of an infant behavioral sleep program at age 6 years on (1) child, (2) child-parent, and (3) maternal outcomes.

**Methods:** Three hundred twenty-six children (173 intervention) with parent-reported sleep problems at age 7 months were selected from a population sample of 692 infants recruited from well-child centers. The study was a 5-year follow-up of a population-based cluster-randomized trial. Allocation was concealed and researchers (but not parents) were blinded to group allocation. Behavioral techniques were delivered over 1 to 3 individual nurse consultations at infant age 8 to 10 months, versus usual care. The main outcomes measured were (1) child mental health, sleep, psychosocial functioning, stress regulation; (2) child-parent relationship; and (3) maternal mental health and parenting styles.

**Results:** Two hundred twenty-five families (69%) participated. There was no evidence of differences between intervention and control families for any outcome, including (1) children's emotional (P = .8) and conduct behavior scores (P = .6), sleep problems (9% vs 7%, P = .2), sleep habits score (P = .4), parent- (P = .7) and child-reported (P = .8) psychosocial functioning, chronic stress (29% vs 22%, P = .4); (2) child-parent closeness (P = .1) and conflict (P = .4), global relationship (P = .9), disinhibited attachment (P = .3); and (3) parent depression, anxiety, and stress scores (P = .9) or authoritative parenting (63% vs 59%, P = .5).

**Conclusions:** Behavioral sleep techniques have no marked long-lasting effects (positive or negative). Parents and health professionals can confidently use these techniques to reduce the short- to medium-term burden of infant sleep problems and maternal depression.

**Key Findings:**
- Longest follow-up study to date (5 years post-intervention)
- No significant differences in any measured outcomes between sleep training and control groups
- No evidence of long-term psychological, behavioral, or attachment harms
- No evidence of long-term benefits beyond improved sleep in infancy
- Study concludes behavioral sleep techniques are safe for long-term use

## 4. Lecuelle et al. (2025) - Sleep Health Commentary

**Full Citation:**
Lecuelle, Florian, Marie-Josèphe Challamel, Michal Kahn, Jodi A. Mindell, Oliviero Bruni, Bruno Claustrat, Reto Anders, Patricia Franco, and Benjamin Putois. "Should you let your baby cry at night? The 'no' rumor persists, despite insufficient scientific evidence with cortisol-stress measures." Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation (2025).

**DOI:** S2352-7218(25)00001-4 (article ID)  
**Publication Date:** February 27, 2025  

**Abstract/Summary:**
Based on available information, this is a recent commentary paper published in Sleep Health that addresses ongoing misconceptions about cortisol and stress responses in relation to behavioral sleep interventions. The paper argues that despite widespread belief that allowing infants to cry during bedtime is harmful, there is insufficient scientific evidence with cortisol-stress measures to support this claim.

**Key Points (from search results):**
- Addresses persistent "rumors" about the harms of letting babies cry during sleep training
- Critiques misconceptions about cortisol function in relation to sleep training
- Argues there is insufficient evidence for cortisol-based claims against sleep training
- Published by international team of sleep researchers and clinicians
- Responds to ongoing debate in the field about stress responses during sleep interventions
