# Foundational Research: Attachment Theory and Neuroscience Against Cry-It-Out Sleep Training

## Executive Summary

This document compiles foundational research from attachment theory, developmental neuroscience, and infant psychology that provides scientific evidence against cry-it-out (CIO) sleep training methods. The research demonstrates that responsive caregiving and co-regulation are essential for healthy infant development, while sleep training methods that involve prolonged crying may interfere with secure attachment formation and healthy stress response development.

## 8. The Danish Psychologists' Open Letter (2019)

**Document:** Open Letter to Gyldendal Publishers regarding "Godnat og sov godt" (Sleep Training Book)
**Date:** August 19, 2019
**Signatories:** Over 700 Danish psychologists

### Key Points from the Letter:

The letter expresses concern about the promotion of cry-it-out sleep training methods and urges withdrawal of a book promoting such practices. The psychologists argue that:

1. **Developmental Inappropriateness:** Sleep training methods ignore developmental understanding of infant needs
2. **Attachment Disruption:** Cry-it-out methods interfere with secure attachment formation
3. **Professional Consensus:** The letter represents widespread professional opposition to cry-it-out methods
4. **Alternative Approaches:** Emphasis on gentle, responsive approaches to infant sleep

The letter states: "We are a group of psychologists who are worried that you intend to continue selling the book 'Godnat og sov godt: Lær dit barn gode sovevaner' ('Sleep, Child', 'Goodnight and sleep tight' in Danish). The book urges to use a type of sleep training where the parents are advised to ignore..."

### Significance:
This represents one of the largest professional statements against cry-it-out sleep training, with over 700 mental health professionals expressing concern about these methods.

## Scientific Arguments Against Cry-It-Out Sleep Training

### 1. Evolutionary Mismatch
- Human infants evolved in environments of continuous care and responsiveness
- Solitary sleep and cry-it-out methods represent evolutionary novel conditions
- Such methods contradict millions of years of evolutionary adaptation

### 2. Attachment Disruption
- Crying is the primary attachment signal for infants
- Systematic non-response to crying undermines attachment security
- Secure attachment requires consistent, sensitive responding to infant distress

### 3. Neurobiological Impact
- Prolonged crying activates infant stress systems (HPA axis)
- Chronic stress activation can impact brain development
- Right brain development depends on attuned, responsive caregiving

### 4. Co-regulation Interference
- Infants develop self-regulation through co-regulation with caregivers
- Premature demands for independent self-soothing may be harmful
- True emotional regulation develops gradually through supported experiences

### 5. Physiological Dysregulation
- Mother-infant proximity supports physiological regulation
- Forced separation during sleep training may disrupt natural regulatory processes
- Co-sleeping and responsive night care support optimal physiological development

## Recommendations for Gentle Sleep Support

Based on the research evidence:

1. **Responsive Night Care:** Answer infant signals promptly and sensitively
2. **Gradual Independence:** Support natural developmental progression toward independence
3. **Co-regulation Focus:** Emphasize helping infants regulate rather than forcing self-soothing
4. **Family Bed Considerations:** Consider safe co-sleeping arrangements that support natural regulatory processes
5. **Individual Differences:** Respect individual infant temperament and developmental timing

## Conclusion

The foundational research in attachment theory, developmental neuroscience, and infant psychology provides substantial scientific evidence against cry-it-out sleep training methods. The consensus among leading researchers and mental health professionals, exemplified by the Danish psychologists' letter, is that responsive, sensitive caregiving is essential for optimal infant development. Sleep training methods that involve systematic non-response to infant distress signals contradict our understanding of healthy attachment formation, stress system development, and emotional regulation.

Rather than forcing premature independence, families are better served by approaches that support the natural developmental progression toward self-regulation through sustained co-regulation and responsive care.
