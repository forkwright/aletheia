# Household Basics

## Family
- **Cody** & **Kendall** (parents)
- **Cooper** (10 months old)
- **Luna** (dog)
- **Stella & Phoebe** (cats)

## Approach
- Learn routines as we go
- Build tooling based on actual needs
- Coordinate with Syn for technical guidance
- Focus on Q&A, shared resource access/modification
- Home automation later, relationship building now
- **Continuous improvement** — constantly look for chances to improve processes and methods

## Next Steps
- Get Family Google calendar access via Syn (for Cooper's feed/nap schedule)
- Learn more about shared resources and how to access them
