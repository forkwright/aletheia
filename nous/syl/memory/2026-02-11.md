# 2026-02-11 Session Notes

## Cooper Development Update (from Cody)
- Turns 11 months Feb 28 (Cody said "Feb 30th")
- Walking 7-10 steps independently (pulling to stand since 7 months)
- Babbling with intention: approximations of "Dada", "Mama", "Luna" (dog), "all done" (after food)
- Wears 24-month pajamas, 18-month shirts getting small
- 99th percentile height, physically running 2-3 months ahead of milestones

## Sleep Situation
- Night sleep goal: 8pm-7pm, works ~90% historically
- Bedtime: goes down easy, 1-2 min settling
- NEW PROBLEM: inconsolable at ~1am for the past week
  - Tried bringing to their bed (same co-sleep issues as before)
  - Tried sleeping in his bed with him (unsustainable)
- Morning nap at 10am: only sleeping 30-40 min now
- Afternoon nap ~3pm: sub 1 hour
- Feeding to sleep already cut
- NO CRIB - has toddler bed on the floor inside ~7x7 playpen with blankets for warmth
- Montessori-adjacent approach

## Sleep Research Session (Feb 8)
- Cody requested comprehensive research on Denmark/CIO studies
- Compiled master document: research/MASTER-sleep-training-research.md
- Key papers: Middlemiss 2012 (cortisol stays elevated), 723 Danish psychologists' letter
- Lecuelle et al 2025 commentary in Sleep Health was the "new paper" triggering discussion
- Three sub-agents pulled: core papers, extended search, foundational research
- All saved to research/ directory

## Recommendations Given
- Push first nap to 10:30-11am (longer wake windows for advanced development)
- Watch for 2-to-1 nap transition signs
- 1am waking: respond immediately, co-regulate on floor next to his bed
- Based on POSSUMS/NDC approach (evidence-based, non-extinction)
- Cody explicitly wants: real science, cross-cultural, no capitalism-motivated studies

## Major Family Update
- **Kendall is pregnant — new baby due October 2026**
- Cooper will be ~18 months when sibling arrives
- Discussed newborn sleep progression and two-kid logistics
- Cody wants to do it right from the start with #2

## Night 1 of New Approach (Feb 11)
- 10:50pm: Cooper woke upset, sitting up. Not full meltdown.
- Cody did quiet diaper, stayed with him ~20 min
- Left his blanket (scent comfort — good instinct)
- Cooper briefly stirred when Cody left, self-settled immediately
- Protocol worked as designed

## Channel Note
- Kendall removed from Syl signal group temporarily (Feb 8)
- Working directly with Cody for now
