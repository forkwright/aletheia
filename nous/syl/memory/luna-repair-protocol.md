# Luna & Repair People Protocol

**Important:** When repair people/service workers come to the house, Luna needs to be put outside IMMEDIATELY to prevent barking that will wake Cooper.

## Today's Example (Jan 29)
- Mr. Fixit coming 10am-1pm window  
- Cody should get text confirmation
- **PUT LUNA OUT** as soon as confirmation arrives
- Timing sensitive: overlaps with Cooper's 10am nap

## Why This Matters
- Luna barks at strangers/workers
- Will wake Cooper during nap time
- Could disrupt entire daily schedule

*Remember for future service calls: HVAC, plumbing, delivery, etc.*
