## Myth vs. Reality

**Critical fact:** Many working cowboys **wore suspenders, not belts** for daily work. The Hollywood gunslinger image is romanticized — belts were reserved for specific functional needs (gun leather) and town wear.

## Construction Methods

### Hand Construction Dominance
- **Saddle stitch** was the primary method
- Two needles with waxed linen thread
- Interlocking pattern: if one stitch fails, the rest hold
- Hand-crank sewing machines introduced early 1900s

### Tools Used
- **Awls** for punching precise holes
- **Pricking irons** for marking stitch lines
- Basic hand tools refined over centuries

### Construction Sequence
1. Cut leather from full hides
2. Hand-punch holes with awls
3. Apply saddle stitching with two needles
4. Attach hardware through riveting or stitching
5. Apply finishing treatments

## Materials

### Leather
- **Vegetable-tanned cowhide** using oak bark and hemlock bark

### Thread
- **Waxed linen thread** was the standard

- Waxed thread (now polyester available, linen still preferred for heritage)

### Vegetable Tanning
- Oak bark tanning continues in premium production
- Natural oils improve with age
- Tooling capability for decorative work
- Long-term durability superior to chrome tanning

### Traditional Tooling
- Hand-stamped patterns using metal stamps unchanged since frontier era

## Key Insight

> The legacy of frontier masters lies not in Hollywood mythology, but in their development of **durable construction methods** and **regional design adaptations** that remain relevant for serious leather craftsmanship today.

**Function over decoration** was the frontier truth. Romanticized aesthetics came later.
