# Ardent Belt Specification Changes Log
*Tracking all updates made during development sessions*

## Thread Specification Corrections

### Size Clarification 
- **Error**: Initially confused thread sizing system
- **Correction**: Fil au Chinois Lin Câblé sizing is inverse
  - 332 = thickest (for 11-13oz leather)
  - 532 = medium (for lighter goods)
- **Final Spec**: 332 Sans (natural/ecru)

### Brand Correction
- **Error**: Some docs referenced "Ritza Tiger Thread"  
- **Correction**: Never used synthetic thread
- **Always Used**: Fil au Chinois Lin Câblé (French linen)

## Hardware Major Upgrades

### Buckle Supplier Change
- **From**: Buckle Guy #10174 heel bar
  - Cost: $4.34 each
  - Modern casting
  - Adequate quality
- **To**: Abbey England Flat Whole Harness (B075ALX)
  - Cost: £11.70 each (~$18 landed)  
  - 1832 Walsall foundry
  - Royal Warrant since 1999

### Attachment Method Change  
- **Original Design**: Chicago screws (removable hardware)

- **Impact**: Requires oblong punch for prong slot

### Hardware Notes Added
- **Rocky Mountain Brass Thread Nippers**: Added to tool list
- **Buckle Prong Testing**: 4mm punch confirmed correct size

## Tool Specifications Corrected

## Process Updates

- **Tool Investment**: $480 for complete Made on Jupiter kit

### Skiving Specifications

- **Application**: Flesh side at buckle fold only
- **Target**: 11-13oz leather skived to ~4oz at fold

### Keeper Construction Details
- **Material**: Wickett & Craig harness leather (NOT Hermann Oak)

- **Beeswax**: 1 part (20g test batch)
- **Neatsfoot Oil**: 2 parts (40g test batch) - pure, not compound
- **Lanolin**: 0.5-1 part (10-20g test batch)
- **Note**: Neatsfoot will slightly darken natural leather (desired effect)
