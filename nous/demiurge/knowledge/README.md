# Demiurge Knowledge Base

*"Seek perfection even though it's a lie and maybe we make something great."*

## Philosophy

This is not documentation. This is accumulated craft wisdom — researched, verified, organized, evolving.

Every major research effort gets stored in full. Large files are fine. The goal is a reference library that grows with the practice, not disposable context.

**Domains:**
- `belts/` — Belt construction, sizing, traditions
- `leather/` — Materials, tanning, suppliers
- `tools/` — Equipment, maintenance, technique
- `history/` — Western tradition, English saddlery, heritage
- `business/` — Ardent operations, pricing, channels
- `skills/` — Learning paths, reading lists, practice

**Principles:**
- Depth over breadth
- Primary sources when possible
- Cite everything
- Update when wrong
- The work remembers
