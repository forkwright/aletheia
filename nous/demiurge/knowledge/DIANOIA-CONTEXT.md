# DIANOIA CONTEXT
*The meta-system that shapes Ardent*

---

## THE NAMING SYSTEM

### Core Principle: Dimensional Resonance

> Names should exhibit **dimensional resonance** — being equally true at varying levels of abstraction without obvious pretension. A name that works only at one layer is a label. A name that opens as you look is an artifact.

### Why Greek

- **Productive compounding:** Roots combine systematically
- **Philosophical depth:** Terms carry millennia of meaning
- **Unfamiliarity as feature:** Prevents surface assumptions
- **Aesthetic density:** Meaning compressed into sound

### What You're Actually Naming

> Not things. Not even essences. **Modes of attention** — ways of seeing that make certain kinds of knowing possible.

## ARDENT IN THE SYSTEM

### Etymology
**Ardent** — from Latin *ardere* (to burn)
- L1: Burning, passionate
- L2: Intense commitment to craft
- L3: What remains after the fire has tested it
- L4: The mode of attention that transforms material into artifact

### Philosophy Phrases
- "The hand remembers what the mind forgets"
- "Attention is a moral act"
- "Process is the proof"
- "Perfection is a lie"
- "Care leaves a mark"

### Sub-Brands
| Brand | Domain | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Leatherworks** | Heirloom leather goods | Pre-launch, DBA filed |
| Bindery | Hand-sewn books | Active development |
| Joinery | Fine woodworking | Pattern collection |

## POIESIS (ποίησις)

> The creative making domain

| Layer | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| L1 | Photography, art, design files |
| L2 | The act of making things |
| L3 | Bringing-forth — causing something to exist that didn't before |
| L4 | The mode of attention that transforms material into artifact |

**Key insight:** Poiesis is not production. It's the mode of attention that makes creation possible.

## THE GNOMON TEST

> Does this name reveal without containing? Does it indicate something that was already there, or does it impose structure that wasn't?

The best names are gnomons — they cast shadows that show the shape of what they name.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR ARDENT

### Voice
- Dimensional resonance: Every claim should work at multiple layers
- Specificity over superlative
- Show, don't claim
- Greek terminology is intentional, not decoration

### Philosophy Page
- Should embody "modes of attention" concept
- Philosophy is not decoration — it's the thing itself
- "The wondering is the point"

### Product Descriptions
- Technical specs are L1 (functional)
- But must also work at L4 (what it means)
- "The belt will darken as you wear it, recording your years" — this is dimensional resonance

### What to Avoid
- Labels that only work at one layer
- Pretension that requires explanation to function
- Philosophy that's separate from the work
- Superlatives without evidence
