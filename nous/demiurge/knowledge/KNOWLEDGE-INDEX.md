## 🚨 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### 1. DUPLICATE/OVERLAPPING CONTENT
- **Philosophy scattered:** `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `PHILOSOPHY-FOUNDATION.md`, and `ardent-brand-philosophy.md` contain overlapping philosophical content
- **Greek terminology:** Both `DIANOIA-CONTEXT.md` and `ardent-greek-terminology.md` cover Greek naming system
- **Materials fragmentation:** Materials info spread across multiple files - could benefit from better consolidation

### 2. INCONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTIONS
- **Mixed case:** Some files use ALL_CAPS (`LEATHER_SOURCES.md`) while others use regular case (`tanning-science.md`)
- **Prefix inconsistency:** Some files prefixed with "ardent-" at root level, others organized by directory
- **README proliferation:** Multiple README files in different directories with varying purposes

### 3. ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES
- **Root directory clutter:** Many "ardent-" prefixed files could be organized into subdirectories
- **Temporary files:** `CHAT-SUMMARY-2026-01-30.md` appears to be session notes rather than permanent knowledge
- **Category boundaries:** Some overlap between `materials/`, `techniques/`, and product-specific information

### 4. POTENTIAL MISSING FILES
- **Master techniques index:** No comprehensive techniques overview
- **Supplier contact directory:** Supplier information scattered across multiple files
- **Quick reference cards:** Could benefit from consolidated quick-reference sheets

## 💡 REORGANIZATION SUGGESTIONS

### 1. CONSOLIDATE PHILOSOPHY
```
philosophy/
├── CORE-PRINCIPLES.md (consolidate main philosophy files)
├── brand-identity.md (Ardent-specific philosophy)
├── greek-terminology.md (consolidated naming system)
└── voice-guidelines.md (brand voice)
```

### 2. STANDARDIZE NAMING
- Convert ALL_CAPS files to kebab-case for consistency
- Remove "ardent-" prefixes where directory structure makes context clear
- Standardize on single README.md per directory with clear purpose

### 3. IMPROVE MATERIALS ORGANIZATION
```
materials/
├── README.md (overview)
├── leather/ (leather-specific info)
├── hardware/ (hardware-specific info)
├── consumables/ (thread, dyes, etc.)
└── suppliers/ (supplier information)
```

### 4. ADD MISSING INDICES
- Create technique master index
- Consolidate supplier contact information
- Develop quick-reference cards for production

---
