## The Core Formula

### Belt Size from Waist
```
Belt Size = Waist Measurement + 2"
```

This is the heritage standard. Measure the body, not pant tags (vanity sizing varies).

### Belt Blank Length
```
Belt Blank = Belt Size + 10.5"
```

**Breakdown:**
- 3.5" for buckle fold-back
- 7" from center hole to tip

**Alternative (longer tail):** Add 11.5" instead (8" from center hole to tip)

**Source:** Don Gonzales Saddlery — "I figure this by adding 10.5" to the measurement from their belt... The 10.5" comes from 3.5" for the flap that folds back at the bend and then 7" from the center hole to the tip."

## Where "Belt Size" Measures To

**Industry Standard:** Buckle fold (pivot point) → Center hole

- **START:** Inside edge of buckle fold (where leather bends around bar)
- **END:** Center hole of 5-hole pattern

**NOT measured to:**
- ❌ End of buckle frame
- ❌ First hole or last hole  
- ❌ Tip of belt

**Why the fold?** This is "mechanical zero" — the functional point where the belt engages, regardless of buckle style.

## Hole Standards

### Count
**5 holes** — traditional and ideal

**Why 5?**
- Odd number creates visual center
- 2 holes tighter, 2 looser from center
- ~4" total adjustment range
- Cleaner appearance than more holes
- Heritage tradition: odd numbers for balance

### Spacing
**1 inch (25-26mm)** center-to-center — universal standard

**Why 1"?**
- Adequate leather between holes (prevents tearing)
- Traditional rule: spacing ≈ strap width
- Meaningful fit changes without being too coarse
- Industry standardization

### Layout
```
Hole 1: Belt Size - 2"
Hole 2: Belt Size - 1"
Hole 3: Belt Size (CENTER - wearing hole)
Hole 4: Belt Size + 1"
Hole 5: Belt Size + 2"
```

**Example (Size 34):**
- Holes at: 32", 33", 34", 35", 36" from buckle fold
- Customer wears on 34" (center)
- ±2" adjustment range

## Tail Length Conventions

### From Center Hole to Tip
- **Standard:** 6-7"
- **Formal:** 6" (refined appearance)
- **Casual:** 7-8" (relaxed look)

### Visual Check
- Tail should reach just past first belt loop
- Too short: doesn't reach first loop
- Too long: extends past second loop

### Beyond Buckle When Worn
- **Dress/formal:** 2-3"
- **Casual/jeans:** 3-4"
- **Work/gun:** 4-6"

## Quick Reference Table

| Pant Size | Waist | Belt Size | Blank Length | Holes (from fold) |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 30" | 30" | 32" | 42.5" | 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 |
| 32" | 32" | 34" | 44.5" | 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 |
| 34" | 34" | 36" | 46.5" | 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 |
| 36" | 36" | 38" | 48.5" | 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 |
| 38" | 38" | 40" | 50.5" | 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 |
| 40" | 40" | 42" | 52.5" | 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 |

## Premium Maker Comparison

| Maker | Holes | Spacing | Sizing Advice | Fit Hole |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Thirteen50 | 5 | 1" | Pant + 3-4" | Center |
| Tanner Goods | 5 | 1" | Pant + 1 size | Center |
| Popov | 7 | 1" | Pant + 2" | Center (4th) |
| Saddleback | 9 | 3/4" | Exact pant size | Center (5th) |

**Note:** Saddleback deliberately rejected "International Belt Standards" for finer adjustment.

## Caveats

- **Women's sizing:** +2" rule does NOT work (different pant conventions)
- **Stretch fabrics:** May need +3-4" for low-rise or stretch
- **Thick leather:** May stretch up to 1.25" with wear (Tanner Goods notes this)
- **Always measure body, not pant tags**
