## Standard Sizing

**Belt size = measurement from buckle fold to CENTER hole (hole 3)**

| Pants Size (true) | Belt Size |
|-------------------|-----------|
| 28 | 30 |
| 29 | 31 |
| 30 | 32 |
| 31 | 33 |
| 32 | 34 |
| 33 | 35 |
| 34 | 36 |
| 35 | 37 |
| 36 | 38 |
| 37 | 39 |
| 38 | 40 |
| 39 | 41 |
| 40 | 42 |

**Rule of thumb:** Belt size = pants size + 2"

---

## How to Measure

**Option A:** Measure current belt from buckle fold (where prong pivots) to most-used hole.

**Option B:** Wrap tape measure around body where belt sits. That's your belt size.

## CCW Sizing (IWB Carry)

*Based on real-world testing with Glock 19 Gen 4, IWB holster @ 4 o'clock*

**Finding:** IWB carry adds approximately **+1"** to belt size needed.

### Recommendation

| Pants Size | No Carry | IWB Carry | Order Size |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 32 | 34" | 35" | 35 or 36 |
| 34 | 36" | 37" | 37 or 38 |
| 36 | 38" | 39" | 39 or 40 |
| 38 | 40" | 41" | 41 or 42 |

**If customer carries daily:** Order belt size = pants + 3"
**If customer carries occasionally:** Order normal size (pants + 2"), use outer holes when carrying

### Hole Usage for CCW Customer

Example: 34 pants, orders size 37 belt (center hole at 37")

| Hole | Position | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 35.5" | Dress / no gun / lighter pants |
| 2 | 36.25" | Casual no carry |
| **3** | **37"** | **IWB daily carry (intended)** |
| 4 | 37.75" | Heavy holster / winter layers |
| 5 | 38.5" | OWB / max adjustment |

## Variables That Affect Fit

- **Holster type:** Kydex thinner than leather
- **Carry position:** Appendix needs more than 4 o'clock
- **Gun size:** Subcompact needs less than full-size
- **Clothing:** Tucked shirt vs untucked
- **Body type:** How much compression available
