| Pant + 3-4" | Thirteen50 |
| Pant + 1 size | Tanner Goods |
| Exact pant size | Saddleback (accounts for extra thickness) |

## Implications for Ardent

### Current Approach
- 5 holes at 1" — matches Thirteen50, Tanner Goods
- Follows traditional standard

### Considerations
- **Popov's 7-hole system** provides more adjustment without looking busy
- **Saddleback's 9-hole/3/4" system** is premium but non-standard
- **5 holes is the heritage choice** — matches English tradition

### Recommendation
Stay with 5 holes at 1" — it's the authentic standard. More holes = more modern/American adaptation.

*The premium makers are variations on heritage themes, not innovations.*
