## Philosophy Integration

Every business decision aligns with the core philosophy: "The work remembers whether you were present." This manifests in:

- **Materials**: No shortcuts, no synthetic alternatives when natural exists
- **Process**: Hand tools only, traditional techniques
- **Pricing**: Transparent about true costs and craft value
- **Marketing**: Education over persuasion, truth over performance
- **Customer service**: Fix rather than replace, teach rather than upsell

The business exists not just to sell leather goods, but to preserve and transmit traditional craft knowledge while building financial sustainability around authentic making.
