## Phase 1: Prep

| # | Step | Tool | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Cut blank | AMPSEVEN strap cutter | 1.5" width |
| 2 | Cut English tip | C.S. Osborne 1.5" | Tail end |

## Phase 2: Edge Work (Main Belt Body)

| # | Step | Tool | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 4 | Sand edges | 220 → 400 → 600 grit | Shape square, long strokes |
| 5 | Hot crease (body only) | M3000 + FN2/FN3 | Skip buckle fold zone |
| 6 | Gum trag + burnish | Canvas/wood slicker | Multiple passes |
| 7 | Final sand | 800 grit | If fibers lift |
| 8 | Ardent wax + final burnish | Wax + canvas | Glassy finish |

**Edge finishing key points:**
- Long strokes (entire belt length) — no wavy/faceted edges
- Pressure on center of edge face, don't wrap onto sides
- No edge dye — natural darkens with use
