# EDGE FINISHING: SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE
*Why it works, not just how*

---

## THE KEY INSIGHT

Edge finishing works by **controlled thermomechanical processing** of collagen fibers.

Every technique—beveling, burnishing, hot creasing—manipulates collagen's response to heat, pressure, and moisture. Burnishing agents (gum, wax) support and enhance these physical processes rather than replacing them.

**Traditional saddlers understood this intuitively; materials science explains why their methods worked.**

## 1. EDGE BEVELING

### Specification
- **Proportion:** ~25% of leather thickness per side
- **Angle:** ~20-30° (tools sized by cut width #0-#4, not angle)

### Why This Proportion
- **Stress distribution:** Eliminates 90° stress risers that concentrate bending forces
- **Bulk retention:** Preserves tensile strength in center
- **Burnishing compatibility:** Creates proper radius for fiber compression
- **Balance:** More than 25% = weak edges; less = insufficient stress relief

### What It Achieves
- Converts sharp stress concentrators into gradual transitions
- Protects grain surface during burnishing
- Creates optimal geometry for fiber sealing

## 2. BURNISHING MECHANICS

### What Actually Happens to Fibers

| Stage | Temperature | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Friction heating | 60-80°C | Approaches collagen glass transition |
| Compression | — | Collapses loose fibrils into dense bundles |
| Plastic deformation | — | Heat softens collagen for permanent realignment |
| Void elimination | — | Compressed fibers squeeze out air gaps |
| Surface glazing | — | Top fibers form continuous glossy layer |

### The Physics
- Collagen fibers behave as **thermoplastic polymers** under controlled heat/pressure
- Hydrogen bonds between fibrils strengthen as they're pressed together
- Surface hardens due to increased fiber density
- Maintains flexibility because bonds remain physical, not covalent

## 3. GUM TRAGACANTH

### Molecular Composition
- **Tragacanthin (30-40%):** Water-soluble, forms films, provides adhesion
- **Bassorin (60-70%):** Swells to viscous gel, provides body and rigidity

### Function by Stage

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| While wet | Hydrated gel lubricates, prevents fiber tearing |
| During compression | Polymer chains align, penetrate between fibrils |
| Upon drying | Forms hydrogen-bonded matrix embedding fibers |

### Why It Works
- Acts as **"grout"** between collagen bundles
- Fills voids with polymer network
- Creates continuous surface film binding loose fibers
- Remains flexible (physical cross-linking)
- Provides darkening and subtle gloss

## 4. HOT CREASING

### Temperature Guidelines

| Range | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Below 65°C | Minimal effect, insufficient for setting |
| **65-100°C** | **Optimal:** Surface collagen softens, reshapes, sets on cooling |
| Above 120°C | Risk of denaturation (collagen unwinds) |
| Above 150°C | Thermal degradation, charring |

### Mechanism
1. Heat increases molecular mobility in collagen surface
2. Allows fiber realignment under pressure
3. Cooling "freezes" new configuration
4. Creates permanent crisp line through controlled plastic deformation

## 5. EDGE PAINT VS. BURNISHING

### When to Burnish
- **Vegetable-tanned leather** (high tannin content responds to heat/pressure)
- Want natural integration (no added materials)
- Durability critical (won't peel or chip)
- Breathability important

### When to Paint
- Chrome-tan, bonded, or exotic leathers that won't burnish
- Need precise color matching
- Covering imperfect laminations or uneven layers
- Thin, supple leathers

### Why Veg-Tan Burnishes Better
- Vegetable tannins create heat-responsive collagen structure
- Natural plant chemistry compatible with compression/heat
- Chrome tanning interferes with fiber compression mechanics

## 6. BEESWAX FINISHING

### Properties
- **Melting point:** 62-65°C (ideal for friction heating)
- **Composition:** Long-chain wax esters + hydrocarbons + fatty acids
- **Character:** Hydrophobic (repels water)

### Function

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Application | Friction heat melts wax, flows into irregularities |
| Cooling | Solidifies into hard, glossy, water-resistant film |
| During burnishing | Reduces friction (boundary lubrication) |
| Long-term | Hydrophobic barrier blocks moisture |

### Why AFTER Burnishing
- Burnishing creates compressed substrate for adhesion
- Wax fills micro-voids left after fiber compression
- Provides final protective layer over structural work

## 7. TRADITIONAL SADDLER SEQUENCE

### 19th Century Method
1. **Trim/square** — Cut layers flush, true with knife/scraper
2. **Bevel** — Edge tool removes sharp corners
3. **Moisten** — Light water/spit/gum prevents fiber fluffing
4. **Burnish** — Hardwood/bone/antler slicker + canvas

### Traditional Materials
- **Gum tragacanth:** Same chemistry as modern use
- **Saddle soap + tallow:** Lubrication and water-shedding
- **Canvas + paraffin:** Heat generation and wax combined

### "French" Finishing
Multiple cycles of sand/dye/burnish for mirror finish — elaboration of basic principles, not different science.

## ARDENT APPLICATION

For Hermann Oak 11-13oz harness leather:

1. **Bevel:** #2 or #3 edger (~25% per side)
2. **Sand:** 320 → 400 → 600 grit
3. **Gum tragacanth:** Light application
4. **Burnish:** Canvas or hardwood slicker, medium pressure, consistent speed
5. **Hot crease:** 80-90°C, ~2mm from edge
6. **Wax:** Ardent wax (beeswax/neatsfoot/lanolin), burnish in
7. **Final pass:** Light pressure to set

The physics don't change. The materials don't lie.
