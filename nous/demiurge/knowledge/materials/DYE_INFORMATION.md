# Dye Information and Philosophy

## Dye Philosophy

### Conceptual Framework
"Each name names a condition, not just a color. The act of dyeing is not decoration—it's an alteration of the skin itself. This is ontological craftsmanship — each piece is a recursive embodiment of its own making."

### Greek Naming System
Dyes are named using Ancient Greek philosophical terms that compress meaning into syllables. The unfamiliarity creates deliberate pause - you see something you don't immediately recognize, you wonder. That wondering is the point.

## The Three Primary Dyes

### Αἷμα (Aima) - "Blood/Life-force"
- **Botanical Base:** Madder root (Rubia tinctorum)
- **Mordant:** Iron
- **Color Result:** Deep oxblood/maroon (#581523)
- **Philosophy:** "Not red. The cost of continuity."
- **Process Notes:** Iron saddens the madder toward maroon, not bright red
- **Historical Context:** Root-blood, used for bridal and burial cloth

### Θανατοχρωμία (Thanatochromia) - "Death-coloring"  
- **Botanical Base:** Logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum)
- **Mordant:** Iron
- **Color Result:** Deep purple-black (#2C1B3A)
- **Philosophy:** "What death leaves behind"
- **Process Notes:** Iron + logwood produces near-black purple
- **Historical Context:** Colonial exploitation, funeral blacks

### Ἀπορία (Aporia) - "Philosophical impasse"
- **Base:** Verdigris (copper patina)
- **Color Result:** Muted green (#5C8E63)
- **Philosophy:** "Between unresolvable truths"
- **Status:** Material returned, never reordered
- **Historical Context:** Copper decay, poison of artists

## Production Method

### Release Schedule
- **NOT made to order**
- **Limited batches only**
- Hand-dyed pieces released when ready
- Philosophy: "Death is worn openly" - mortality acknowledged in timing

### Process Philosophy
"The hide already carries the animal's life — scars, shade variations, tick marks. Adding dye integrates more mortal matter: madder (once root), logwood (once tree). The mordant fixes these ghosts of colors into pores, making memory permanent."

## Ingredients as History

### Logwood
- Colonial exploitation history
- Used for funeral blacks
- "Logwood is the shadow cast by empire"

### Madder
- Root-blood of the plant
- Traditional bridal and burial cloth dye  
- "Centuries of human ritual saturated in this red"

### Verdigris
- Copper corrosion/decay
- Artist's poison through history
- "The green that appears when metal accepts time"

### Iron (Mordant)
- "Blood-rust, weapon and wound"
- Chemical bridge between dye and hide
- Essential for color permanence

## Color Accuracy

### Hex Codes (Corrected)
Original estimates were adjusted after research:
- **Aima:** #581523 (darker, more brown than bright red)
- **Thanatochromia:** #2C1B3A (much darker, near-black purple)  
- **Aporia:** #5C8E63 (lighter, more saturated green)

### Color Matching Note
"The real answer: you'd need to dye swatches, photograph under D50/D65 light with a gray card, and pull actual hex values. Process-dependent."

## Application Methods

### Integration with Philosophy
- **No surface treatment:** Color penetrates hide structure
- **Mordant-dependent:** Iron creates permanent color bonds
- **Aging consideration:** Colors mature and deepen with wear
- **Documentation:** "The work remembers whether attention was paid"

## Current Status
- **Aima & Thanatochromia:** Recipes documented, ready for production
- **Aporia:** Needs material reorder (verdigris returned)
- **Production:** Hand-dyed pieces released in limited batches
- **Primary offering:** Natural russet harness (undyed) for launch

## Supplier Research Needed
- Source for authentic madder root
- Source for logwood chips
- Source for verdigris (replace returned material)
- Iron mordant (ferrous sulfate) sourcing
- Traditional dye-making equipment/vessels
