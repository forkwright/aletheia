## Philosophy Integration

### Material Selection Criteria
Every material choice reflects core principles:
1. **Provenance over convenience** - Know the maker/source
2. **Heritage methods** - Traditional processes that improve with time  
3. **Natural materials** - "Synthetic ONLY when necessary"
4. **Quality ceiling** - Best available in each category
5. **Honest construction** - No hidden compromises

### Greek Dye System (Future)
- **Αἷμα (Aima):** Madder + iron = oxblood (#581523)
- **Θανατοχρωμία (Thanatochromia):** Logwood + iron = deep purple (#2C1B3A)
- **Ἀπορία (Aporia):** Verdigris = muted green (#5C8E63)
- **Release:** Limited batches, not made-to-order

## Process Decisions

### Construction Methods
- **No Chicago screws:** Buckle stitched directly for permanence
- **No edge beveling:** Squared edge for honest construction
- **No grooved stitching:** Proud thread display (332 size)
- **Hot edge creasing:** Traditional finishing with M3000 creaser

### Edge Finishing Process
1. Sand progression: 220 → 400 → 600 grit
2. Apply gum tragacanth  
3. Burnish with wooden tool
4. Apply Ardent wax (beeswax + neatsfoot + lanolin)
5. Final burnish with canvas

## Quality Standards

### Non-Negotiables
- **Single-layer construction** (no glue bonding)
- **Solid brass hardware** (no plating)
- **Natural fiber thread** (linen over synthetic)
- **Traditional tanning** (vegetable over chrome)
- **Heritage suppliers** when quality ceiling is achieved

### Philosophical Alignment
"The work remembers whether you were present. Materials carry forward the attention paid during their creation. Hermann Oak leather from 1881, Abbey brass from 1832, French linen from 1898 - these represent accumulated knowledge and craft refinement across generations."

## Market Positioning

### Competitive Analysis
- **Below premium:** Hermès, bespoke English makers ($300-800)
- **Above good:** Popov, Tanner Goods ($100-150)  
- **Quality differentiation:** Single-layer Hermann Oak + Abbey brass
- **Price justification:** Material heritage story + construction transparency

### Cost Transparency Philosophy
Materials cost breakdown shared openly:
- Shows labor represents 73% of value
- Demonstrates no markup games on materials
- Builds trust through honest pricing
- "The labor IS the value"
