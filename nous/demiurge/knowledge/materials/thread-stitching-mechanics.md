# THREAD AND STITCHING MECHANICS
*Deep technical knowledge for Ardent construction*

---

## FIL AU CHINOIS LIN CÂBLÉ

### Why It Matters
- Manufacturing linen thread since **1827** (popular since 1850s)
- Gold standard — still used by **Hermès**
- Superior câblé process creates strongest construction

### Câblé Manufacturing Process
1. **Initial twist** — Linen fibers twisted into threads
2. **Assembly** — Multiple twisted threads combined
3. **Moistening** — Critical step: threads dampened
4. **Re-twisting** — Second twist while moist prevents fiber distortion
5. **Result** — Perfectly round, strong thread

The moisture treatment prevents natural linen fiber distortion under tension.

### Size Standards (Lin Câblé)

| Size | Diameter | Length/50g | Application |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **332** | 0.77mm | ~133m | Heavy-duty: belts, straps, harness |
| 432 | 0.63mm | ~200m | Medium weight |
| 532 | — | — | Regular weight (special order) |
| 632 | 0.51mm | ~285m | Fine: luxury European aesthetic |
| 832 | — | — | Finest (special order) |

**For Ardent belts: 332 Sans** (heaviest, matches 11-13oz harness leather)

## SADDLE STITCH PHYSICS

### Why It's Superior

**Saddle stitch:** Single thread, two needles, figure-8 pattern through each hole
**Machine lock stitch:** Two threads that interlock, creating structural interdependence

### The Critical Difference

| Property | Saddle Stitch | Machine Lock Stitch |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Thread pattern | Independent knots | Interlocked chain |
| If one breaks | Others remain intact | Entire seam unravels |
| Load distribution | Across leather itself | Stress at interlock points |
| Repair | Replace failed section | Re-stitch entire seam |

**Each saddle stitch functions as an independent knot.** This is the engineering advantage that makes hand-stitched goods last generations.

## WAXING THREAD

### What Wax Does
- **Lubrication** — Reduces friction during stitching
- **Waterproofing** — Moisture barrier protecting thread
- **Strengthening** — Binds individual fibers together
- **Preservation** — Protects against humidity degradation
- **Workability** — Prevents tangling and fraying

### Wax Quality (Fil au Chinois)
- Light application, non-sticky
- Doesn't transfer to hands
- Doesn't wipe off easily
- Doesn't need additional waxing for most work

## STITCH SPACING

### General Guidelines

| Spacing | Teeth Per Inch | Application |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| ~2.8mm | 9 TPI | Universal, most thread sizes |
| ~3.6-4.2mm | 6-7 TPI | Thick thread, heavy leather |
| ~2.1-2.3mm | 11-12 TPI | Fine thread, luxury aesthetic |

### Determinants
- **Leather thickness** — Thicker = wider spacing
- **Thread thickness** — Must accommodate without stress
- **Aesthetic** — Western = wider; European luxury = closer

### Ardent Standard
**3.85mm spacing** (approximately 6.5 TPI) — matches 332 thread on 11-13oz harness leather

## THREAD-TO-HOLE RATIO

### Principles
- Thread should fill hole without creating excessive stress
- Proper fit prevents tear-out under load
- Adequate fill prevents moisture penetration
- Proportion impacts visual quality

### For Ardent
- 332 thread (~0.77mm) with proportional hole size
- Pricking iron creates angled holes
- Thread fills but doesn't force

## LINEN VS. POLYESTER

| Property | Linen | Polyester |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Source | Natural flax fiber | Plastic polymer |
| Appearance | Soft, organic | Consistent, glossy |
| Strength | Very strong | Stronger |
| UV resistance | Moderate | Superior |
| Heritage | Traditional craft | Modern |
| Aging | Develops character | Stays same |

**Ardent uses linen** — matches heirloom philosophy, develops character with leather.
