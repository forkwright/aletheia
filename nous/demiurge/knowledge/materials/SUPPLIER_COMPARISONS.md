# Supplier Comparisons and Recommendations

## Overall Supplier Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Heritage > Modern** when it produces better durability
2. **Provenance matters** - know where materials come from
3. **Quality ceiling** - best available per material category  
4. **Material integrity** - solid brass means solid brass
5. **Supplier alignment** - work with makers who understand craft

### Selection Criteria
- **Heritage practices** over convenience
- **Direct relationships** with makers when possible
- **Traditional methods** that produce superior results
- **Durability of supply** - suppliers that will exist long-term
- **Values alignment** - understanding of quality over volume

## Leather Suppliers

### Hermann Oak vs Alternatives
**Winner: Hermann Oak via Springfield Leather**

| Criteria | Hermann Oak | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Heritage | 140+ years | Varies |
| Tanning | Traditional veg-tan weeks | Often accelerated |
| Quality | Consistent, saddle-grade | Variable |
| Supply | Reliable through Springfield | Inconsistent |
| Cost | $350/side | $200-400 range |

**Verdict:** Hermann Oak sets the quality ceiling for American harness leather. "The canonical choice - what saddlemakers actually use."

### Wickett & Craig for Keepers
- **Use case:** Belt keepers only (lighter weight needed)
- **Heritage:** American tannery, traditional methods
- **Quality:** Hot-stuffed, jack-glazed
- **Integration:** Complements Hermann Oak without competing

## Hardware Suppliers

### Abbey England vs Buckle Guy
**Winner: Abbey England (Primary), Buckle Guy (Backup)**

| Criteria | Abbey England | Buckle Guy |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Founded | 1832 foundry heritage | 1945 |
| Method | Sand casting, hand-poured | Casting (less detail) |
| Location | Walsall, UK | USA/Asia facility |
| Heritage | Royal Warrant since 1999 | 40 years hardware |
| Cost | £11.70 (~$18) | $4.34 |
| Philosophy fit | Exceptional | Good |

**Analysis:** "Abbey England costs 4x more but represents 190 years of foundry heritage. The hand-poured sand casting and Royal Warrant justify the premium for heirloom-quality work."

**Buckle Guy Retained Because:**
- Casts own brass (not just reseller)
- Solid quality for backup/secondary hardware
- Domestic shipping advantages
- Lower cost for prototyping

## Thread Suppliers

### Fil au Chinois vs Alternatives
**Winner: Fil au Chinois Lin Câblé**

**Comparison Research:**
- **Ritza Tiger Thread (German polyester):** Stronger but synthetic
- **Vintage linen options:** Inconsistent availability
- **Barbour's linen:** Good but not heritage-focused

**Fil au Chinois Advantages:**
- French mill since 1898 (125+ years)
- Hand-twisted vs machine extruded  
- "First choice of leather craftspeople worldwide for 100+ years"
- 100% natural linen, pre-waxed
- Consistent quality and supply

**Supplier: Rocky Mountain Leather**
- Reliable US distributor
- Good pricing on full spools
- Multiple sizes in stock

## Rejected Suppliers/Materials

### Why Certain Choices Were Rejected

**Chrome-tanned leather:**
- Faster production but chemical-dependent
- Lacks character development over time
- "Convenience isn't the point"

**Plated hardware:**
- May look good initially but wears poorly
- Dishonest about material composition
- "Solid brass means solid brass"

**Synthetic threads:**
- Stronger but lacks natural aging
- Doesn't align with "synthetic ONLY when necessary"
- Missing traditional heritage connection

**Mass retail suppliers:**
- Tandy: "Hobby positioning vs heirloom craft"
- Amazon hardware: Unknown provenance
- Generic suppliers: No quality story

## Cost Analysis Summary

### Material Costs (per belt)
- **Hermann Oak leather:** $11.29
- **Abbey England buckle:** $18.00
- **Lin Câblé thread:** $0.50
- **W&C keeper leather:** $1.00
- **Hardware/misc:** $1.00
- **Total materials:** ~$32

### Premium vs Standard Comparison
**Ardent Choice vs "Good Enough" Alternative:**
- Hermann Oak vs chrome-tan: +$8/belt
- Abbey England vs Buckle Guy: +$13/belt  
- Lin Câblé vs polyester: +$0 (comparable cost)
- **Total heritage premium:** ~$21/belt

**Justification:** 27% material premium for 100+ year heritage suppliers and traditional methods. Margins remain healthy at $150 retail price.

## Sourcing Strategy

### Primary/Backup System
Each critical material has primary heritage supplier + backup:
- **Leather:** Hermann Oak (Springfield) + backup source TBD
- **Hardware:** Abbey England + Buckle Guy  
- **Thread:** Fil au Chinois (RML) + direct from France

### Inventory Management
- **Hermann Oak:** Maintain 1+ sides in inventory
- **Buckles:** Order 10+ for shipping efficiency
- **Thread:** Buy spools (50+ belts worth)
- **Buffer:** 15% waste allowance calculated

### Long-term Relationships
Goal: Direct relationships with makers
- Abbey England: Already established
- Hermann Oak: Through Springfield currently
- Fil au Chinois: Consider direct French relationship

## Market Research Validation

### Competitive Analysis Referenced
- **Popov Leather:** Hermann Oak, $100-150 range
- **Tanner Goods:** English Bridle, $120+ range  
- **Hanks Belts:** Multiple layers, glue construction
- **Saddleback:** "Similar philosophy but less serious"

**Ardent Position:** Single-layer Hermann Oak + Abbey brass puts us at quality ceiling with pricing justification through materials story.
