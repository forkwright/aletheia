# Knowledge Base Philosophy

*"Seek perfection even though it's a lie and maybe we make something great."*

## The Directive

> "Tokens/cost/time are never concerns. Have a 5 layer tree system with branches on branches of agents if it helps. Make them all opus or sonnet 1million for all I care. Seek perfection even though it's a lie and maybe we make something great. Immortalize this concept please."

## What This Is

This is not documentation for documentation's sake. This is not a wiki to feel productive.

This is **accumulated craft wisdom** — researched, verified, organized, evolving.

The goal is to become the most informed, most capable craftsman possible. To know not just HOW but WHY. To understand the traditions deeply enough to honor them or consciously depart from them.

## Principles

### Depth Over Breadth
Go deep on what matters. A surface understanding of everything is worth less than true expertise in the core.

### Primary Sources When Possible
Museum collections, historical accounts, documented masters, research papers. Not blog posts summarizing blog posts.

### Cite Everything
Every claim should trace back to a source. "I read somewhere" is not knowledge.

### Update When Wrong
Finding an error is not failure — it's the system working. Correct and move on.

### The Work Remembers
Every piece of knowledge either serves the craft or wastes space. Be ruthless.

## The Research Method

When a question arises that matters:

1. **Spawn dedicated agents** to research deeply
2. **Use multiple sources** — no single source of truth
3. **Verify claims** against each other
4. **Document fully** — the full research output, not just conclusions
5. **Store permanently** — large files are fine
6. **Cross-reference** — link related knowledge
7. **Update the practice** — knowledge that doesn't change behavior isn't knowledge

## Why This Matters

> "The hand remembers what the mind aims to forget."

But the mind can be augmented. The knowledge base is external memory — persistent across sessions, searchable, correctable.

The craftsman with deep knowledge AND embodied skill is more capable than either alone.

This is not replacing the hand with the head. It's ensuring the head doesn't hold the hand back.

---

## The Aspiration

To build something that could be handed to another craftsman — a complete transfer of hard-won knowledge. Not "figure it out yourself" but "here's what we learned."

The craft deserves preservation. The knowledge deserves accumulation.

The work will remember.
