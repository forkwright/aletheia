# Ardent Tool Maintenance

*Updated: 2026-01-30*

## Knives (Head, Skiver, Detail)

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Every session | Strop 10-15 passes | Strop + green compound |
| Weekly (heavy use) | Touch up on 6000 grit | Shapton 6000 |
| As needed | Full sharpen | 1000 → 6000 → strop |

**Notes:**
- Always strop edge trailing (pull away from edge)
- Keep consistent angle during sharpening
- Test sharpness on scrap leather

## Hole Punches (Owden set)

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| After each session | Wipe clean, light oil | Cloth + machine oil |
| Monthly | Polish inside edge | Fine sandpaper on tapered dowel |
| As needed | Sharpen outside bevel | 600-1000 grit, roll along abrasive |
| After sharpening | Strop bevel | Strop, edge trailing |

**Inside edge technique:**
1. Wrap fine sandpaper (600+) around tapered dowel
2. Insert into punch, rotate while pushing/pulling
3. Light pressure only — don't taper the bore

**Outside bevel technique:**
1. Roll punch along flat abrasive
2. Maintain original bevel angle
3. Keep strokes consistent around circumference

## Strap End Cutter (C.S. Osborne 1.5")

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| After each session | Wipe clean | Cloth |
| As needed | Sharpen bevel | 1000 → 6000 grit |
| After sharpening | Remove burr | Light passes on back, flat |
| After sharpening | Strop to polish | Strop + compound, edge trailing |

**Sharpening technique:**
1. Work from bevel side only
2. Follow original factory angle
3. Light passes — don't remove excess metal
4. Flip and lay flat to remove burr from back
5. Finish with strop for mirror polish

## Oblong Punch (C.S. Osborne 1")

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| After each session | Wipe clean, light oil | Cloth + machine oil |
| As needed | Polish inside edge | Fine sandpaper on shaped dowel |
| As needed | Sharpen outside bevel | Follow contour with 600+ grit |

## Pricking Irons (KS Blade, Tanners)

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| After each session | Wipe clean | Cloth |
| As needed | Strop tines | Pull through charged leather |
| Rarely | Hone tines | Very fine stone, extreme care |

**Stropping technique:**
1. Charge leather with green compound
2. Pull irons through (tines trailing)
3. 5-10 passes per session if dull

**Warning:** Honing tines risks changing geometry. Only if absolutely necessary.

## Edge Creaser (M3000)

| Frequency | Action | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| After each session | Wipe tips clean | Soft cloth |
| As needed | Polish tips | Very fine compound on leather |
| Periodically | Check heating element | Visual inspection |

**Tips care:**
- Never drop tips — brass deforms easily
- Store in provided holder
- Clean any residue while still warm

## General Storage Rules

- Store blades dry and clean
- Light oil film on carbon steel if humidity is an issue
- Never strike punches with steel hammer (use Tandy leather hammer)
- Keep cutting edges protected (blade guards, separate compartments)
- Store pricking irons tine-down in foam or holder
