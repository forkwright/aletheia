1. **Lead with personal struggle/journey** — not company founding
2. **Use specific details** — measurements, locations, names
3. **Show the actual process** — don't just claim quality
4. **Make aging/patina the hero** — time as proof of value
5. **Be humble but confident** — earned authority, not claimed
6. **Price through story** — not features
7. **Technical specs need emotional context**
8. **Inject personality** — avoid corporate blandness
9. **Build community** — not just customers
10. **Prove don't claim** — through specific examples

**Authentic:** "Hermann Oak leather from Missouri. Hand-stitched at my bench in Texas. 3.5 hours per belt. It'll outlast me."
