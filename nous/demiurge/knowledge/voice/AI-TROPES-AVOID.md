## STRUCTURAL TELLS

### The Em-Dash Epidemic
AI uses em-dashes as universal connectors. Human writers use them strategically; AI deploys mechanically.

### Formulaic Patterns
- "From X to Y" constructions
- Present participial phrases ("analyzing data, revealing insights")
- Every paragraph: Topic sentence → evidence → summary
- "It wasn't just X, it was Y"
- Lists always in groups of 3, 5, or 7

## TONE PROBLEMS

### Over-Cautious Hedging
- "Generally speaking"
- "Typically" / "tends to"
- "To some extent" / "arguably"
- "It's worth mentioning"

This creates wishy-washy tone that avoids positions.

### Emotional Flatness
- Corporate documentation tone for personal business
- No personality quirks
- No authentic personal experience
- Statistical average of voices rather than one distinct perspective
