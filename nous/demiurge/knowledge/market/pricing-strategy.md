# PRICING STRATEGY FOR HANDMADE LEATHER GOODS
*How to price profitably and premium*

---

## THE KEY INSIGHT

> **Compete on story, quality, and service — not price.**

Small makers cannot win on cost. They win on positioning, craftsmanship, and experience.

---

## HYBRID PRICING MODEL

### Cost-Plus = Floor (Survival Line)
```
(Materials + Labor + Overhead) × 2-3 = minimum price
```
Never sell below this.

### Value-Based = Ceiling
- Charge based on perceived value
- Superior materials, craftsmanship story, limited runs
- Works best direct-to-consumer

---

## PRICE TIERS FOR BELTS

| Tier | Price Range | Position |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Mass market full-grain | $100-150 | Below you |
| **Credible handmade premium** | **$200-350** | Target range |
| Exotic/custom/numbered | $400+ | Halo products |

**Note:** $150 is actually below the "credible handmade premium" range. Room to grow.

## THREE-TIER PRODUCT LADDER

### Entry Level ("Good")
- **Products:** Card holders, key fobs, simple belts
- **Purpose:** Low-risk first purchase, gift-friendly
- **Margin:** Lower, but builds customer relationship

### Mid-Tier ("Better") — Volume Seller
- **Products:** Everyday wallets, detailed belts
- **Price:** $220-280 range
- **Purpose:** Main revenue driver, best value perception

### Premium ("Best") — Halo
- **Products:** Special editions, custom orders, numbered pieces
- **Price:** $450-600+
- **Purpose:** Brand positioning, high margins, exclusivity

---

## PRICE ANCHORING

### Psychology
- Display highest-priced item first
- Makes mid-tier feel like "sensible choice"
- Premium validates quality of entire line

### Structure
```
Halo product:     $450-600 (exotic, numbered)
Hero/mainline:    $220-280 (your volume seller)
Ultra-premium:    $700-900 (atelier piece)
```

## DISCOUNTING (AVOID)

### Why Discounting Hurts
- Customers learn to wait for sales
- 30-40% lower lifetime value
- Erodes brand image
- "Race to the bottom" mentality

### If You Must
- One-time first-order incentive only
- Threshold offers: "$20 off orders over $150"
- End-of-line clearance (clearly marked)
- Rare, time-bound events

### Better Alternatives
- Add value instead of cutting price
- Free monogramming
- Conditioning kit included
- Dust bag
- Early access for loyal customers

---

## CUSTOM/BESPOKE PRICING

### Base + Add-On Menu
| Customization | Price |
|---------------|-------|
| Custom size adjustment | +$20-40 |
| Color/edge options | +$15-30 |
| Monogramming | +$10-25 per location |
| Hand-tooled panels | Hourly rate + minimum |
| Full bespoke design | Design fee + hourly |

### Protection
- 50%+ deposit before starting
- Non-refundable design fee for one-offs
- Clear menu prevents endless negotiation

---

## TRANSPARENCY

### What Works
- Frame as education about "true cost" of ethical, handmade
- Use ranges/percentages, not exact dollar breakdowns
- "Most payment goes to materials and labor"
- Show fees upfront (shipping, customization)

### What Hurts
- Granular breakdowns that invite "but leather only costs $X"
- Transparency as apology for price
- Incomplete accounting that looks inconsistent

---

## TARGET MARGINS

| Product Type | Materials % of Retail |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Small goods (wallets) | 20-25% |
| Bags, larger items | 25-30% |

**Final retail:** 3-5× material cost for small goods

---

## IMPLICATIONS FOR ARDENT

### Current State
- $150 belt with ~$32 materials = 3.9× markup ✓
- Below "credible premium" range ($200-350)
- Room to increase without losing market

### Options
1. **Keep $150** — accessible entry, build volume
2. **Raise to $175-200** — move into premium range
3. **Create tiered line** — $150 basic, $225 premium, $400+ custom

### Recommended Path
- Start at $150 to prove demand and gather testimonials
- After 20-30 sales with strong reviews, consider increase
- Introduce premium tier with tooling/dyes at $200+
- Never discount — add value instead
