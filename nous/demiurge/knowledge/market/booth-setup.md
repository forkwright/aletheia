## DISPLAY PRINCIPLES FOR LEATHER GOODS

### Height Variation
- **Eye level:** Featured belt on display stand
- **Mid level:** Valet trays, laid flat with one elevated
- **Table level:** Additional inventory, business cards

### Let Them Touch
- Have a **sample belt** people can pick up and feel
- Quality sells itself when they feel the leather weight
- Don't hover — let them explore

### Less is More
- Don't overcrowd the table
- Space between items = perceived value
- **Abundance without clutter**

### Tell the Story
- Small sign: *"Hand saddle-stitched. Hermann Oak leather since 1881. Solid brass hardware."*
- Let the materials speak — no need for hard sell

### Lighting (if indoor/evening)
- Battery-powered LED strip lights
- Spotlight on featured piece
- Warm tone, not harsh white

## PRO TIPS FROM LEATHER VENDORS

1. **Roll belts loosely** — shows the curve/flexibility, not stiff
2. **Display at least one belt at full length** — people need to see it unbuckled
3. **Price visible** — customers won't ask, they'll just walk away
4. **Wear your own product** — best advertisement
5. **Have custom order forms ready** — "Not your size? I can make it."
6. **Bring a stool** — standing all day is brutal
7. **Arrive early** — best parking, setup without rush
8. **Practice your pitch** — 10 seconds: "Hand-stitched belts from American leather. Built to last decades."
