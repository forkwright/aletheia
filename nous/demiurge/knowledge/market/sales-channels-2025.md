# SALES CHANNELS FOR SMALL LEATHER MAKERS (2025-2026)
*What's actually working now*

---

## CHANNEL RATINGS

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Own Website | 🟢 Best ROI | $22 return per $1 spent, but hardest to build |
| TikTok/YouTube | 🟢 High potential | Process videos, 2-3 months to build community |
| Craft Markets | 🟢 Viable | With right selection (affluent areas, holiday) |
| Instagram | 🟡 Pay-to-play | Organic dead, need Reels + paid |
| Etsy | 🟡 Difficult | Algorithm changes, flooded with mass-produced |
| Amazon Handmade | 🟡 Mixed | 15% fee requires healthy margins |
| Wholesale/Faire | 🔴 Avoid | "Destroying the industry" |

---

## ETSY (🟡 INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT)

### Reality
- **Fees:** 6.5% transaction + $0.20 listing + 3-4% payment = ~10% total
- **2025:** Many sellers report worst year yet
- **Problem:** Algorithm now favors app traffic; flooded with Chinese goods reposted from Amazon

### What Works
- Items under $100 with "free shipping" built into price
- Heavily SEO-optimized listings
- Consistent posting schedule, seasonal items

### What Doesn't
- Basic SEO and hoping for the best

---

## INSTAGRAM (🔴 ORGANIC DEAD)

### Reality
- Organic reach confirmed dead for most small businesses
- Need $500-1000/month minimum for reliable paid ad data

### What Works
- **Reels:** Behind-the-scenes crafting videos
- **UGC:** User-generated content campaigns
- **Micro-influencers:** 1K-10K followers (higher engagement than macro)

### Dead Strategies
- Posting product photos expecting organic discovery

---

## OWN WEBSITE (🟢 BEST LONG-TERM)

### Reality
- **ROI:** $22 return for every $1 spent
- **Conversion:** 14.6% organic vs 1.7% paid
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months minimum for SEO results
- **Investment:** $500-2000 upfront, $200-500/month ongoing

### What Works
- Local SEO: "handmade leather goods [city]"
- Content marketing around craftsmanship/process
- Email list building from day one
- Strong reviews and testimonials

---

## CRAFT MARKETS (🟢 STILL VIABLE)

### Booth Costs (2025)
- Local markets: $100-250
- Regional shows: $250-1000
- Major shows: $1000-5000+

### What Works
- Local farmers markets in **affluent areas**
- Holiday markets (Nov-Dec)
- Maker-focused events

### Avoid
- Oversaturated general craft fairs with mass-produced competition

---

## WHOLESALE (🔴 INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC)

### Traditional Reality
- Retailers want 60-70% margins
- Minimums $500-2000

### Faire Platform (AVOID)
- Takes significant cut
- Forces constant discounting
- Flooded with mass-produced goods
- "Destroying the industry" — many small makers reporting

### What Works Instead
- Direct relationships with boutique stores
- Consignment (60/40 split)
- Local retail partnerships

---

## TIKTOK/YOUTUBE (🟢 HIGH POTENTIAL)

### What Works (2024-2025)
- **TikTok Creator Fund:** $0.40-1.00 per 1K views
- **Content:** Process videos, "satisfying" leatherwork, before/after
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months for community, 6 months for substantial ROI
- **Stat:** 80% of consumers take action after seeing creator content

### YouTube
- Longer-form tutorials
- Craftsmanship content
- Brand building over time

---

## DEAD STRATEGIES (2025)

1. Facebook organic posts
2. Basic Etsy SEO
3. "Build it and they will come" websites
4. Faire wholesale
5. Generic Instagram content
6. Traditional trade shows
7. Email blasts without segmentation

---

## WINNING COMBINATION (2025-2026)

1. **Own Website + Local SEO** — long-term foundation
2. **TikTok Process Videos** — discovery and brand building
3. **Strategic Craft Markets** — direct sales and feedback
4. **Email Marketing** — nurture and repeat customers
5. **Direct Retail Relationships** — skip the platforms
6. **Instagram Reels** — behind-the-scenes content

**The Reality:** Multi-channel required. Video content essential. Direct relationships > platform dependence.

---

## IMPLICATIONS FOR ARDENT

- Own website is correct primary channel
- Need process video content (TikTok/Reels)
- Skip Faire entirely
- Consider craft markets in Austin affluent areas
- Build email list from day one
- Etsy only if heavily optimized
