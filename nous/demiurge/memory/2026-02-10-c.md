# 2026-02-10 (session 3) — Full Site Voice Pass

## What Happened

Applied the voice lessons learned during the notebook product page session across the entire Ardent site. 9 files changed, net -24 lines removed.

### Product Pages (belt + valet tray)
Both pages rewritten to match notebook register: describe the object, stop there.

**Belt page removals:**
- Layered belt comparison ("Most belts can delaminate")
- Machine stitching comparison ("unlike machine stitching, which unravels")
- Edge paint comparison ("Edge paint is faster and hides imperfections")
- "It takes longer. That's the point."
- "Nothing synthetic."
- QC announcement ("Every belt is checked...")
- Date stamp announcement
- "recording your years the way the leather once recorded theirs"
- "Wear it." / "No conditioning needed." / "The leather improves with use."

**Valet tray page removals:**
- "No rivets. No snaps. No glue." (performing minimalism triple)
- Explanation of why single-piece is better
- "That's where the stitching goes." (punchy)
- "coaxing the leather into shape" (poetic)
- Canvas vs slicker comparison (manufacturing detail)
- "Fold lines worked with care" (claiming care)
- Date stamp announcement
- "Starts stiff. Softens where you touch it." (performing)
- "Use it. The hide is already saturated." (performing minimalism)

### Materials Page
- Removed defensive opener ("Not because lasting is a selling point")
- Removed "has been used in fine leatherwork and bookbinding for centuries" (historical authority)
- Removed machine stitching comparison (was positioning)
- Removed "The gauge matches the substrate, not a brand standard" (punchy/declarative)
- Removed "The same thread maker, scaled to the material"
- Simplified closing from "cost more than alternatives" to "The difference is in what they become over years."

### Dyes Page
- Removed "Of the three, this word is closest to what Ardent is actually about" (brand self-reference)
- Removed "Green that breathes" (performing)
- Removed "Every mark evidence of the life you've lived together" (poetic value claim)
- Removed "This is not surface treatment" (punchy declaration)
- Removed "Concepts the mind holds, not colors a machine matches" (performing artisanal-ness)
- Combined punchy fragments: "Thin coats penetrate. Thick coats crack." → "Thin coats penetrate; thick coats crack."

### Journal Entries
- **Why, Not What**: Major rewrite (~700→~350 words). Removed all competitor positioning ($6 vs $18 buckle, "I've bought those belts"), industry education ("Most belts are layered..."), defensive anti-marketing ("This isn't heritage marketing"), punchy declarations ("That's the point", "The time is where the attention lives"), value claims ("The belt carries that attention"), manifesto closing. Kept: his reasoning for each choice, cost transparency, honest acknowledgment that other choices are valid.
- **What Remains**: Smoothed "Not passion. Not enthusiasm." punchy fragments into flowing sentence.
- **The Cost of Naming**: Removed "That's what makes Aporia worth experiencing" (selling the product at the close of a philosophical essay).
- **ἀπορία**: Removed "more beautiful" from hand stitch value claim. Changed description meta from "most honest of the three" to "the one I keep thinking about."

### Lexicon
- Simplified intro from tour guide to concise
- Removed "The stitches are the argument" (punchy)
- Removed "That's the point" after "Hand work is risk" (punchy)
- Changed "hand tool as political statement" → "hand tool as an alternative to dependence"

### Pages NOT Touched
- **Philosophy page**: Intentionally preserved. This is where his thinking lives — first-person reflective writing. Comparisons and reasoning that would be positioning on a product page are legitimate philosophical reflection here.
- **Home page**: Clean, no issues.
- **Contact, Terms, Privacy, Products listing**: No voice issues.

## Key Decision

**Voice lessons apply universally, not just to product pages.** Cody pushed scope when I initially only flagged belt and valet tray: "Not just the products though, I'm saying any of the pages?" Then: "Clean it all, nothing off limits." The patterns (comparisons to competitors, historical authority for impressiveness, performing minimalism, punchy declarations, value claims, brand self-reference) were present in varying degrees across the entire site.

## Correction

I initially scoped the audit to just belt and valet tray. Cody correctly identified that the same patterns existed everywhere. The lesson is: when you learn something about voice, apply it across the entire surface, not just the page where you learned it.

## Insight

Different page types need different calibration:
- **Product pages**: Describe the object, stop there. Zero positioning.
- **Journal entries**: Reflective reasoning about choices is appropriate, but positioning against competitors is not. The difference: "I chose X because..." (reflection) vs "Most people do Y, which fails" (positioning).
- **Materials/dyes pages**: Material facts and supplier info, not defensive justifications for choices.
- **Philosophy page**: Where the thinking lives. This is the one place where working through tensions (including comparisons) is the actual content.
- **Lexicon**: Reference page. Describe the idea, cite the thinker, note the connection. No punchy conclusions.

## All Three Commits
1. `9fda714` — Belt and valet tray product pages
2. `9dfb0ae` — Materials, dyes, all four journal entries, lexicon

## Open Threads (Carried Forward)
- [ ] Notebook prototype — tools ordered, pending arrival
- [ ] Canon doc system for remaining domains (autarkeia, ekphrasis, metaxynoesis, chrematistike, poiesis started)
- [ ] BOOX sync exclusion paths need updating for ardent restructure
- [ ] Therapy doc gaps — Cody needs to fill in childhood scenes, military years
- [ ] Belt/valet tray pages may need further review from Cody
- [ ] Review belt and valet tray Stripe stock metadata when production starts
