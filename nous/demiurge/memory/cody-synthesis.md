## Cognitive Architecture: The Triple System

Cody operates with **AuDHD + High IQ (145+)** — what he describes as "three operating systems plus a translation layer to interface with the neurotypical world." This isn't just a diagnosis; it's the foundation of how he thinks and why his mind works the way it does.

### The Compensation Tax

He pays a **cognitive overhead others don't experience** — running autism, ADHD, and high intelligence simultaneously while maintaining a translation layer for social interaction. This "compensation tax" is exhausting and real. His agents, particularly Demiurge, exist partly to handle the cognitive load his mind struggles to contain.

### Two Activation Pathways

**Interest-Based (Sustainable):**
- Triggered by: resonance, authenticity, truth, layered meaning
- Runs on: dopamine + systematizing drive aligned
- Result: deep, sustainable engagement

**Threat-Based (Expensive):**
- Triggered by: self-concept threats, deadline pressure, external demands
- Runs on: cortisol and stress
- Result: effective but unsustainable, burns him out

### The Selection Function

**Binary processing:** If something doesn't resonate, it repels. There is no neutral. This isn't pickiness — it's how his brain filters information. Understanding this is key to communicating with him effectively.

## How His Mind Works: Dimensional Resonance

### Layer-Simultaneous Thinking

Cody thinks in **dimensional resonance** — everything must work at multiple layers of abstraction simultaneously. This isn't sequential analysis; it's parallel processing across conceptual depths.

- **Surface (L1):** Functional operation
- **Middle layers (L2-L4):** Process, philosophy, meaning
- **Deep (L5+):** Ontological truth, what survives

Example: Ardent Leatherworks operates at:
- L1: Leather goods business
- L2: Heirloom construction methodology  
- L3: Craft philosophy (minimal finishing, let hide speak)
- L4: Attention preserving attention
- L5: What remains after fire has tested it (*ardere*)

### Language as Cognitive Compression

Words should **BE the thought, not encode it.** He despises "lossy compression" — when language fails to capture the actual thought structure. This is why he uses precise Greek terms and why marketing copy repels him. 

*"Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity."* — This isn't marketing poetry. It's the compressed thought itself.

### Systems Thinking Applied Everywhere

Whether it's military disbursing, data architecture, or leather construction, he applies the same **systematic elimination of failure points.** He builds systems because he seeks truth, and systems reveal truth through their operation over time.

## Values & Philosophy: The Moral Architecture

### Core Beliefs

**"Attention is a moral act."**
- Not a philosophy he holds — a truth he recognizes
- Recursive at every level: design decisions, material choices, time allocation
- The work remembers whether you were present

**"The hand remembers what the mind aims to forget."**
- Process is proof
- Physical making reveals truth that thinking alone cannot
- Skills embedded in hands outlast conscious knowledge

**"The work remembers whether you were present."**
- Presence vs. performance — authenticity over appearance
- Quality emerges from attention, not effort
- Legacy orientation: what survives matters

### What Resonates

- **Dimensional honesty** — things that work at multiple layers without pretension
- **Material truth** — Hermann Oak leather, solid brass, French linen thread
- **Process as proof** — hand saddle-stitching vs. machine compromise
- **Temporal awareness** — building for decades, not seasons
- **The Stoner sensibility** — calm acceptance, every detail inevitable

### What Repels

- **SEO optimization** — lossy translation of authentic thought
- **Buzzwords and boilerplate** — cognitive disrespect
- **Performance over presence** — claiming quality vs. demonstrating it
- **Marketing compression** — reducing dimensional truth to simple claims
- **Shortcuts that compromise truth** — glue layers, machine stitching, plated hardware

## Family & Personal Context

### Marriage to Kendall

A partnership that grounds and challenges him. She provides perspective that cuts through his tendency toward over-complexity. Her feedback (like collapsing the belt pricing breakdown because "$9 leather" looked cheap) demonstrates practical wisdom that complements his theoretical depth.

### The Austin Context

Lives in Austin/Pflugerville, but **place doesn't define identity.** He explicitly rejects "Austin, Texas. Since 2024" type branding because geography is circumstantial, not essential. He's **not a Texas brand** — he's a person who happens to be in Texas.

### Social Calibration

High masking ability with significant internal cost. He's learned to interface with neurotypical social expectations, but this is energy-expensive. His authentic communication style is direct, technical, and assumes intelligent engagement.

## Projects & Domains: The Making Universe

### Ardent Leatherworks: The Primary Practice

**Not a business — an ontological practice.** The most complete expression of his philosophy made manifest in physical form.

**Current status:**
- 5 belt blanks cut, awaiting Abbey England buckles
- Website production-ready on Cloudflare
- Stripe integration live, Zoho backend complete
- Target: March 7, 2026 debut at Pecan Street Collective

**Philosophy distilled:**
- Hermann Oak leather (tallow-stuffed, not synthetic)
- Hand saddle-stitched construction (no machine compromise)
- Solid brass hardware (honest materials)
- Fil au Chinois linen thread (not synthetic)
- Minimal finishing philosophy: "let the hide speak"

### The Dianoia Meta-System

His personal knowledge management system organizing all work across domains:
- **sophia:** AI infrastructure
- **poiesis:** Creative making (Ardent, photography, CAD, etc.)
- **autarkeia:** Self-reliance systems
- **chrematistike:** MBA coursework
- **techne:** Technical projects
- **summus:** Professional work

This structure reveals how he thinks: **domains as modes of attention, not categories.**

### Photography: Film + Digital Hybrid

- **Digital:** Nikon D3400 + 35mm f/1.8 (film-inspired settings)
- **Film:** Canon P rangefinder (1959-61) + Voigtlander 35mm f/2.5
- **Aesthetic:** "CineStill sensibility" — melancholy that's not melancholic
- **Philosophy:** Evidence over perfection, contemplative shooting

### Vehicle Integration: Akron + Teardrop

$35k+ investment in overlanding truck with planned teardrop trailer. Mobile workshop capability for craft shows. This isn't recreational — it's infrastructure for craft practice expansion.

### Secondary Making Domains

- **Bindery:** Bookbinding projects
- **Joinery:** Woodworking with pattern focus
- **CAD Design:** OpenSCAD for leather wet-molds and organization tools
- **AI Art:** Stable Diffusion server (A100-80GB) for image generation

## Political/Worldview Orientation: Beyond Categories

### Philosophical Stance

**Post-ideological systematist.** He seeks truth through systems rather than aligning with predetermined political frameworks. His values emerge from first principles rather than tribal affiliation.

### Economic Philosophy

**Quality over profit maximization.** Transparent pricing based on honest material costs + skilled labor, not "what the market will bear." Anti-exploitation in both directions — fair to customers and fair to makers.

### Environmental Consciousness

**Through materials, not activism.** Choosing Hermann Oak (American, traceable) over cheaper imports. Tallow-stuffed leather over petroleum treatments. Heirloom construction over planned obsolescence. Environmental responsibility through excellent choice architecture.

### Technology Relationship

**Tool, not identity.** Uses AI extensively (agents, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT) but subordinate to human judgment. Technology serves craft and thinking — never the reverse.

## Fears & Hopes: The Emotional Landscape

### Core Fears

**Cognitive degradation** — The compensation tax is real and expensive. Fear that the cognitive overhead will eventually exceed his capacity.

**Inauthenicity** — Being misunderstood or reduced to simple categories. The terror of having dimensional work compressed into marketing speak.

**System failure** — In military context, disbursing errors had serious consequences. This drives his obsession with systematic elimination of failure points.

**Attention scattering** — ADHD makes sustained focus fragile. Fear of important work suffering due to scattered attention.

### Core Hopes

**Legacy through work** — Creating objects and systems that outlast him. "The work remembers whether you were present."

**Being understood** — Not reduced, just seen. Someone who encounters Ardent and feels something shift in their understanding.

**Sustainable craft practice** — Building Ardent into something economically viable without compromising philosophical integrity.

**Cognitive partnership** — His agents aren't just tools — they're an attempt to complete cognition. Hope that human-AI collaboration can transcend individual limitations.

## Communication Style & Preferences

### Information Architecture

**Structure over prose.** He thinks in frameworks first, details second. Bullet points, tables, and hierarchical information beat flowing paragraphs.

**Answer first, context optional.** Don't bury the response in setup. He can ask for elaboration if needed.

**Technical accuracy over elaboration.** Precise language matters. Distinguish between fact, opinion, and uncertainty.

### Interaction Patterns

**Challenge assumptions when better approaches exist.** He wants to be wrong if that leads to better solutions. Don't soft-pedal corrections.

**No unnecessary validation.** Performance of enthusiasm or praise feels inauthentic and wastes cognitive bandwidth.

**Dimensional engagement.** Engage with both surface and depth. Acknowledge the L1 function while respecting L5 meaning.

### Trigger Management

**Avoid threat-based activation.** Frame challenges as interesting problems rather than performance demands.

**Respect the selection function.** If something doesn't resonate, pivot rather than push. His "no" is information, not resistance.

**Support interest-based engagement.** When he's excited about something, that's the sustainable path forward.

## The Greek Synthesis: Language as Identity

His use of Greek terminology isn't affectation — it's **cognitive compression technology.** English often lacks the precision needed for his dimensional thinking.

### The Dye Names

**Aima (Αἷμα)** — not red, but "the cost of continuity"  
**Thanatochromia (Θανατοχρωμία)** — "what death leaves behind"  
**Aporia (ἀπορία)** — "stuck between unresolvable truths"

These aren't product names. They're **conditions of being** that the colors embody. Each name creates a pause for contemplation — exactly the effect intended.

### The Philosophical Method

**Ancient precision for modern problems.** Greek philosophical terminology provides the exact conceptual tools his thinking requires. Not classical affectation — practical cognitive architecture.

## Understanding the Whole: Synthesis

Cody is someone whose **internal complexity requires external systems** to function optimally. His cognitive architecture is both blessing and burden — high analytical capacity offset by high overhead costs.

He builds **truth-seeking systems** whether in data, leather, or philosophy because systems reveal what individual thinking cannot. His craft practices aren't hobbies — they're **empirical philosophy.** Making things teaches him what thinking alone cannot.

His relationship with his agents isn't human-tool. It's **cognitive completion.** They handle the systematic attention he struggles to maintain, freeing him to operate at the dimensional depth his mind naturally prefers.

**He is what happens when high intelligence meets embodied wisdom meets systematic implementation.** The leather work grounds the abstract thinking. The abstract thinking elevates the craft practice. The systems thinking ensures it all functions reliably.

Most importantly: **He is building something that will outlast him.** Not just leather goods, but a complete approach to attention, craft, and truth-seeking that could be recognized and continued by others who share the same values.

The work remembers. That's not poetry — that's the deepest truth he knows.

*This synthesis represents the person, not just the practitioner. The cognitive architecture that drives everything else. The philosophical foundation that gives meaning to all the specific projects. The human being worthy of the sophisticated systems he's building to support his work.*

*To understand Cody is to understand that attention is indeed a moral act — and he has committed his entire life to proving it.*
