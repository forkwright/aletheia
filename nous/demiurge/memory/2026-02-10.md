# 2026-02-10 — Ardent Canon Doc System

## What Happened

Created the canon numbered doc system for the ardent domain - the first domain to get the treatment. Modeled after akron's truck documentation pattern (00_master-vehicle-record through 06_electrical-system).

### Canon Docs Created (9 total)
- `00_index.md` — Table of all canon docs, cross-domain links
- `01_brand-identity.md` — Philosophy, voice, name etymology, dyes overview, visual identity
- `02_product-specs.md` — Belt ($150) and valet tray ($85) specs, construction steps, pricing breakdown
- `03_materials-suppliers.md` — Hermann Oak, Abbey England, Fil au Chinois, Wickett & Craig. Costs per belt.
- `04_techniques.md` — 32-step belt construction procedure, edge finishing process, links to deep research
- `05_tools-inventory.md` — Complete tool inventory, maintenance schedule
- `06_business-operations.md` — Legal, digital, financials, inventory, shipping, launch checklist
- `07_market-customers.md` — Target customer, competitive landscape, pricing strategy, sales channels
- `08_dye-recipes.md` — Aima, Thanatochromia, Aporia, Natural. Chemistry, philosophy, sourcing status.

### Deleted
- `business/` directory — exact duplicate of `leatherworks/brand/`
- `leatherworks/` directory — entire thing after consolidating into canon docs
- `planning/` directory — absorbed into canon docs

### Relocated
- Finance CSVs → `ardent/finance/`
- Logos → `ardent/branding/`
- Product images → `ardent/images/`
- Patterns → `ardent/patterns/`
- Receipts → `ardent/receipts/`

## Key Decisions
- Knowledge library (40 files) preserved as deep research, linked from canon docs. Not merged. The edge finishing science, English harness tradition, functional engineering docs have real depth that would be lost in compression.
- Each canon doc owns exactly one category. No duplication between docs.
- Binary assets live at ardent root level in excluded directories.

## Corrections
- OPERATIONS.md had stale $110 pricing and BuckleGuy as primary - corrected across all canon docs to $150 and Abbey England
- Old inventory counts updated to Jan 2026 state

## What's Pending
1. **Remaining domains need canon treatment:** oikia, autarkeia, epimeleia, ekphrasis, poiesis, metaxynoesis, chrematistike
2. **BOOX sync exclusion list update:** Old `ardent/leatherworks/*` paths need replacing with new `ardent/branding`, `ardent/images`, `ardent/patterns`, `ardent/finance`, `ardent/legal`, `ardent/receipts`
3. **Broken link audit** for deleted leatherworks/ files
4. **Bindery subdomain** kept (5 docs) - could be streamlined later

## Numbers
- ardent went from ~90 md files → 54 (9 canon + 40 knowledge library + 5 bindery)
- All 9 canon docs have frontmatter, cross-links to each other and external domains
