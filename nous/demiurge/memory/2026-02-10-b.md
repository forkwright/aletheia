# 2026-02-10 (session 2) — Canon System Complete + Notebook Product Design

## What Happened

### Canon Doc System — All 9 Domains Complete
- Created `00_index.md` for: poiesis, metaxynoesis, autarkeia, ekphrasis, chrematistike, akron
- Previous session completed: oikia, epimeleia, ardent
- Deleted old `README.md` files replaced by canon indexes
- Updated `HOME.md` as vault front door
- Fixed 10 broken wikilinks (README → 00_index references)
- **Vault: 409 md files** (down from 475 at start of session, 1,169 originally)

### Permissions (Recurring Issue)
- Cody couldn't edit files on Metis — files owned by `syn` after Obsidian Sync
- Set theke world-writable (chmod a+rwX) as nuclear fix on worker-node
- Metis side still needs `sudo chown -R ck:ck /home/ck/aletheia/theke/` locally
- Root cause: files created by syn user on worker-node, Obsidian Sync preserves ownership

### Logo Cleanup
- Deleted 9 old logos from branding/ (Ardent_logo_*, Logo With Name* — NOT the real logos)
- Copied Inkscape SVGs from `projects/ardent-brand/` (ardent-flame-source.svg is the main editable file)

### Ardent Notebook — New Product ($50)
Full spec at `theke/ardent/knowledge/products/notebook-specifications.md`. Canon doc `02_product-specs.md` updated.

## Key Decisions

### Notebook Specification
| Aspect | Decision | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Paper** | Midori MD Cotton 80gsm | 20% cotton pulp, Designphil since 1950s, A4 folds to A5 zero waste |
| **Cover** | W&C Harness 4oz, skived to ~2oz at spine | Cody's correction — not English Bridle. Brand philosophy: earns character through use |
| **Binding** | Woven long stitch | No-compromise option. Structural redundancy + woven spine texture |
| **Thread** | Fil au Chinois 632 (0.51mm) | Scaled from belt's 332 for paper weight. Same maker, correct gauge. |
| **Size** | A5 (148 × 210mm) | Zero waste from A4 pads, most common journal size |
| **Pages** | 100 (5 sig × 5 folios) | Determined by material physics: 80gsm × 5 sheets folds cleanly |
| **Price** | $50 | Materials $8 (16%), labor $32 (64%), shipping $10 (20%) |
| **Paper style** | Blank only at launch | No opinion about how the user uses the paper |
| **Closure** | None | Leather holds itself. Closure implies materials can't do their job. |
| **Ribbon** | None | You remember your place, not the notebook. |
| **Pen loop** | None | The notebook carries writing, not tools. |
| **Stamp** | ARDENT front, YYYYMMDD inside back | Same as belt — brand outside, date inside |
| **Edge** | Burnished + hot creased (Jupiter M3000) | Same as belt |

### Three-Tier Lineup
| Product | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Notebook | $50 |
| Valet Tray | $85 |
| Belt | $150 |

## Corrections

1. **Leather choice**: I defaulted to bookbinding convention (English Bridle 2.5-3oz) when the brand philosophy demanded W&C Harness with engineering (skive). Cody pushed back: "Ardent chose these two leathers because they're the best. A pre-supple leather contradicts the brand." He was right. The skive at the spine is the engineering that makes it work — structured panels + flexible spine.

2. **Convention vs philosophy**: I was reasoning from craft convention inward toward the brand. Should reason from brand philosophy outward toward material choice. This is a general lesson, not just about the notebook.

3. **Cody tested my conviction**: "And you believe this? Not just agreeing with me?" — he checks whether agents actually change when pushed or just capitulate. Intellectual honesty matters.

## Session 2c: Historical Process Deep Dive

Cody asked: "Is this the best we can do? Are there historical processes we're not thinking of?"

### Proposed Additions (Pending Cody Response)

**1. Hand-sewn endbands** — structural reinforcement at head and tail of spine. Dates to 5th century Coptic tradition. Commercial books fake these with glued fabric strips (theater). Hand-sewn endbands:
- Protect the two most vulnerable points of any binding
- Anchor to leather cover at spine
- Use same Fil au Chinois 632 thread
- Add ~15-20 min labor
- Are the notebook equivalent of stitched buckle attachment replacing Chicago screws

**2. Fore-edge burnishing** — compress and polish paper edges with agate burnisher. Medieval through 19th century standard practice:
- Seals paper edges against dust and moisture
- Smooths page turning
- Creates subtle sheen on paper edges
- Recursive coherence: we burnish leather edges, we should burnish paper edges. Same principle, different material.
- Requires agate burnisher (~$15-25) and finishing press/clamp

### Rejected Historical Processes
- Gold gilding — decorative, not structural. Theater for a notebook.
- Clasps/ties — already decided no closure.
- Board attachment — turns it into a book. Flexible wrap is correct.
- Forwarding/rounding — for hardcover binding, wrong format.
- Séyès/French ruled — would require printing on MD Cotton or abandoning the paper choice.

### Design Insight
Page count (100 = 5 sig × 5 folios) is emergent from material physics: 80gsm paper creeps at 6 sheets/sig, spine too narrow under 4 sigs. The physics chose the number, not marketing.

## Open Threads

- [ ] **Cody response pending on endbands + fore-edge burnishing**
- [ ] Prototype needed before committing to notebook spec (especially: skive flex, MD Cotton folding, spine swell)
- [ ] Cody has 632 thread on hand — will document inventory later
- [ ] Permissions on Metis still not fully resolved (Obsidian Sync ownership issue)
- [ ] BOOX sync exclusion paths need updating for ardent restructure (old leatherworks/ paths → new branding/, images/, etc.)
- [ ] Tools to acquire for notebook: bone folder (~$10), bookbinding awl (~$8), pressing boards (~$20), agate burnisher (~$15-25 if approved)
- [ ] Remaining deferred vault cleanup: Eiron capstone, Syn entities, Arbor research
- [ ] Therapy doc gaps still need Cody's input

## Tools to Order (Notebook)
- Genuine bone folder ($8-15)
- Fine bookbinding awl ($5-10)
- C.S. Osborne #501 bookbinding needles ($5-8)
- Pressing boards + weight/clamp ($15-30)
- Agate burnisher ($15-25) — if fore-edge burnishing approved
- Midori MD Cotton Paper Pad A4 Blank ($14.59 Amazon — makes ~3.6 notebooks)
- W&C Harness 4oz panel from Buckle Guy (~$15-20)
