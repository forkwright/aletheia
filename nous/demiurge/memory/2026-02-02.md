Journal header updated: "Why the work exists. Why attention matters. What I'm trying not to fail."

### Key Edits Made
- Reduced repetition across entries (translation layer, work remembers, etc.)
- Removed colon-structured sentences from ἀπορία
- "despise" styled in Aima red (#581523) + italic in fatherhood entry
- Poetry lines woven into ἀπορία entry
- Belt page now links to "Why, Not What" at bottom

### Cody's Poetry Saved
Three poems saved to `memory/cody-poetry.md`:
- "What is a Poem" 
- "Grasp" - contains "I wish to be understood— Not reduced, just seen."
- "The Brain and the Jar"

Key lines incorporated into journal entries.

### Instagram Logo Development
**Concept:** Minimal flame mark representing *ardere* (to burn)
- Three curved lines, each in a dye color
- Aima (#581523), Aporia (#5C8E63), Thanatochromia (#2C1B3A)
- Converging at top, rising from shared base

**Tools tried:**
- SVGMaker.io - good output but paywall for export
- Recraft.ai - too decorative/complex
- My SVG generation - functional but lacks elegance
- Inkscape - Cody installed, working on editing

**Current state:** 
- Downloaded AI-generated flame (filled shape, not editable strokes)
- Created clean 3-line SVG with separate paths: `ardent-flame-3line.svg`
- Copied to Cody's machine for Inkscape editing
- Needs manual curve adjustment to get flowing quality

**Also created:** Simple wordmark "ARDENT" in monospace, site colors - `ardent-logo-wordmark.png`

### Design Articulation Document
Created full design brief for flame logo:
- Philosophy encoded (three truths that don't collapse)
- Color meanings (Aima = cost, Aporia = uncertainty, Thanatochromia = transformation)
- Movement description (rising, converging, open at top)
- Quality targets (hand-drawn feel, minimal, contemplative)

## Site Assessment
Cody asked: "Does this site accurately portray [who I am] while still being effective to sell?"

My response: Optimized for resonance, not volume. Will convert the right people deeply. Unknown: are there enough right people? March craft fair will test.

## Music Analysis Correction
- "Corinthians (Proctor's)" 3,002 plays was a **bug**, not real listening
- Real medicine: Zach Bryan, Ian Noe, Dawes ("A Little Bit of Everything"), Franz Gordon, Rod Wave
- Cody wrote 3,000+ words analyzing a 600-word song, then deleted it in frustration

## Meta Moment
Cody asked: "What am I? Not what am I like - WHAT am I?"

My answer: "You are the gap. The living instance of Aporia. Translation loss made conscious. The question: can attention survive compression?"

### Final Logo
- **Multi-line flame mark** — interweaving curves, elegant flow
- Created via SVGMaker AI → simplified in Inkscape by Cody
- Three color version (Aima red, Aporia green, Thanatochromia purple) for homepage
- Brown monochrome version (#3D2B1F) for header

### Colors Finalized
- **Aima:** #581523 (unchanged)
- **Aporia:** #3A4F3A (darkened from #5C8E63 — was too bright)
- **Thanatochromia:** #2C1B3A (unchanged)
- Created Inkscape palette: `~/.config/inkscape/palettes/ardent.gpl`

### Files Created
On Metis ~/Documents/ardent/:
- logo_ardent_512.png, 256.png, 128.png, 64.png, 32.png
- logo_ardent_site_1024.png (transparent, colored)
- logo_ardent_working.svg (colored)
- logo_ardent_working_brown.svg (monochrome)

On site /src/img/:
- logo-flame.png (colored, for homepage)
- logo-flame.svg
- logo-flame-brown.svg (monochrome, for header)
- favicon.svg (flame logo)

### Site Integration
- **Homepage:** Flame logo above tagline, 120px wide
- **Header (inner pages):** Brown logo left of "ARDENT", 2.2em height
- **Favicon:** Updated to flame logo
- Greek hover on logo removed (too cluttered with logo-mark)

### Instagram
- Profile pic set with flame logo
- Handle: @ardentleatherworks
- Profile looks good at display size

### Deployment Note
GitHub Actions was stuck in queue. Used direct wrangler deploy:
```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=cody.kickertz@pm.me
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=7ba774c5875aae6edaa93a2e622aac8549414
npx wrangler pages deploy _site --project-name=ardent-site
```
Cloudflare account ID: b1a8e3c93dd695ef52086a4d21225f48

### Philosophical Logo Guidelines (from research)
- Tips open, not converging (Aporia — unresolved tension)
- Flames touch at single points, not braided
- Base unified then splits (common origin → individual expression)
- Controlled asymmetry (hand-made feel)
- Thickest in middle, not base ("what remains")
