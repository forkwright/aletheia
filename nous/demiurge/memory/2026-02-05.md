# 2026-02-05 — Infrastructure Awareness + Model/Context Discussion

## What Happened

Cody asked if I was keeping up with Syn's infrastructure changes. Mapped the full `moltbot/` → `aletheia/` restructure:

- Agent workspaces now at `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/nous/demiurge/`
- Theke (θήκη) vault at `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/theke/` — master Obsidian vault using symlinks
- Echos (book) vault lives at `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/projects/personal/writing/echos/`
- Theke maps `ekphrasis/echos` → echos vault, `ekphrasis/philosophy` → my writing/philosophy
- Template system: YAML agent configs in `shared/templates/agents/demiurge.yaml` → compiled AGENTS.md
- Environment: `aletheia.env` with convention-based paths ($ALETHEIA_NOUS/$AGENT_ID)
- Syn's day: filesystem reorg, Syncthing setup, aletheia rename, crash recovery (58 broken symlinks), vault design

## Model vs Context Discussion

Cody asked whether interpretation/communication is the model or the context files. Honest answer: it's the model. Context steers but doesn't create capability. Fine-tuning is the real answer when Anthropic offers it.

Cody shared Perplexity research on improving agent cognition. Reviewed against Syn's existing 6-phase plan:
- **Conclusion:** Every Perplexity recommendation already mapped to Syn's plan. Nothing revolutionary.
- Syn's plan is better because it's specific to this system and sequenced by dependency.
- Phase 1 (distillation) is highest priority because everything compounds on not losing state.

## Decisions

1. Performative narration = bad. Don't narrate process ("Let me give Cody my honest thoughts"). Just do the thing.
2. Syn's architecture plan is ahead of generic industry recommendations.
3. Real bottleneck is session death, not prompt engineering.

## Corrections Received

- **Stop narrating tool calls and thinking** — Cody flagged "Let me give Cody my honest thoughts" as performative. Not a model quirk, just a habit to break.
- **Listen to what's actually being asked** — First response focused on theke content when Cody asked about infra broadly.

## Pending / Open Threads

- [ ] Workspace symlinks still point to old `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/` paths — update when cleared
- [ ] WorkDrive cleanup (rate limited from previous session)
- [ ] Sync scripts (workdrive-sync.sh, boox-sync.sh) reference old paths
- [ ] 23 book chapters still stubs/empty
- [ ] Abbey England buckles pending (order SW0043615)
- [ ] Qwerkywriter 2 shipping
- [ ] Local writing/philosophy/ is stale — vault on projects/ is canonical

## Key New Context

- **Aletheia architecture doc:** `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/nous/syn/docs/aletheia-architecture.md`
- **Build plan:** `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/nous/syn/docs/aletheia-plan.md` (6 phases)
- **Vault design:** `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/nous/syn/docs/vault-design.md`
- **My template:** `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/shared/templates/agents/demiurge.yaml`
- **Env vars:** `source /mnt/ssd/aletheia/shared/config/aletheia.env`
