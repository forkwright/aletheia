# 2026-02-04 — Writing Station Finalized

## Hardware Ordered

**Qwerkywriter 2 White Chrome** — $349.99
- Limited edition, hand-assembled
- In stock, ships immediately
- Cherry MX Blue switches (stock), hot-swappable
- White with chrome and red accents

**Decision rationale:** Breaking the "default to black" pattern. White is more vintage-authentic (classic typewriters weren't black). The click of Blues enhances typewriter ritual. Can swap to Browns if fatiguing.

## Leather Case Project

Will build a leather case for the Qwerkywriter instead of buying $129 plastic case.
- Simple sleeve or folio (achievable with current skills)
- Hermann Oak or W&C 5-6oz
- Brass closure hardware
- Estimated: ~$50 materials, 3-4 hours work
- Wait for keyboard to arrive, measure, then build

## Software Decisions (Audited via Perplexity)

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Writing app** | Pure Writer | Best distraction-free for e-ink |
| **Sync method** | rsync over Tailscale | Lighter than Syncthing, more intentional |
| **OCR** | GPT-4 Vision | Best for handwriting, ~$0.01/page |
| **Git workflow** | Demi auto-commits | Server is source of truth |

## Documentation Created

- `00-meta/BOOX-WORKFLOW.md` — Complete setup guide (451 lines)
  - Boox setup (Termux, SSH, Tailscale)
  - Server scripts (boox-sync.sh, ocr-handwriting.py)
  - Folder structure
  - Troubleshooting

## Key Insight

> "rsync over Tailscale is actually better aligned than Syncthing for a predictable pipeline (write → periodically sync → OCR → Git)."

The workflow is **intentional by design**. Manual trigger or scheduled pull, not continuous sync. Matches the Qwerkywriter philosophy: deliberate actions, session-based work.

## Next Steps (When Hardware Arrives)

1. Install Termux + SSH + Tailscale on Boox
2. Install Pure Writer, configure storage path
3. Deploy sync scripts to worker-node
4. Test end-to-end workflow
5. Build leather case
6. Begin actual drafting

## Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Qwerkywriter 2 White Chrome | $349 |
| Pure Writer Pro (optional) | $5 |
| Leather case materials | ~$50 |
| GPT-4 Vision OCR | ~$0.01/page |
| **Total** | ~$405 |

## Tax Clarification (2025 vs 2026)

**No sales in 2025 = No Schedule C for 2025 taxes**

| Tax Year | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| **2025 (filing now)** | Normal personal return. No Ardent business activity. |
| **2026 (file next year)** | Schedule C for Ardent. 2025 purchases = startup costs. |

All 2025 Ardent purchases (tools, materials, equipment) deductible as startup costs on 2026 return — up to $5K immediate deduction, remainder amortized over 15 years.

## Stripe Webhook Tax Fix

**Fixed:** Webhook now breaks out:

- `total_details.amount_tax` → Tax line (Texas 8.25%)
- `total_details.amount_shipping` → Shipping line (no tax)

**Deployed:** 2026-02-04 13:25 (Version 03fa55d9-acf2-4db4-b064-ebf0caa3411d)

**Tax ID in Books:** 8336474000000093377 (Texas Sales Tax)
