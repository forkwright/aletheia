# Session 2026-02-08

## Obsidian Vault Audit & Cleanup (early session)
- Echos de-repoed (removed .git, GitHub repo already archived), now plain folder in theke
- 12 writing plugins consolidated from echos → theke (longform, typewriter-mode, sentence-rhythm, prozen, writing-goals, etc.)
- obsidian-git removed (going Obsidian Sync), core sync plugin enabled
- HOME.md fixed: all 15 domains link to `[[domain/README|domain]]`, removed dead apodemia/, added personal/
- Created 7 README.md index files for domains that lacked them
- Trashed .philosophy-archived-20260207 (8.6 MB stale)
- AnuPpuccin theme + .keep-the-rhythm data moved to vault level

## Obsidian Sync for BOOX
- 13 folders excluded: mouseion/library, poiesis/imaging, chrematistike/fa25, akron/database, akron/dodge_ram/photos, akron/dodge_ram/manual_processing, akron/enfield/manual_processing, akron/enfield/manuals (1.7G), autarkeia, poiesis/cad, poiesis/handcraft, portfolio, summus
- Kept chrematistike/sp26 (current semester)
- ~50 MB syncing to BOOX after exclusions
- BOOX purpose: writing, reading, maybe core Ram docs

## Syncthing Audit
- Only syncs worker-node ↔ Metis (no BOOX). No conflict with Obsidian Sync.

## Therapy History Document — MAJOR SESSION WORK
Created `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/theke/metaxynoesis/therapy-history.md` for Tom's individual history session (couples therapy, one hour each while other listens).

### Approach
- Chronological guide, not script. Glance-down anchors for when working memory dips.
- Factual with perspective as felt THEN, not reframed through current AuDHD lens.
- Bracketed questions mark genuine gaps. Cody fills in over time.
- Exhaustive search across all agent memories, theke vault, session logs to build skeleton.
- Key source docs: mouseion/identity/understanding_me.md (written for Kendall), clinician_briefing.md (for therapist), audhd_integration_notes.md (Jan 17 session), cognitive_profile.md

### Biographical Facts Confirmed
- Ages 0-11 with mom (Lake Livingston area). Constant moves every ~6 months. Zero stable friendships.
- Mom: alcoholic, had cancer (chemo), always "I'm dying", abusive fiancé Asher
- Lynn (great aunt) and Kenna: one night blocked bloodied drunk mom from taking Cody home. Also alcoholics. Good memory: Lynn's husband, LOTR and Hellboy.
- Grandparents (dad's side): took care of him summers. Grandpa died of lung cancer (Cody there, couldn't speak at funeral). Grandma got dementia, mistreated, Cody didn't visit much.
- Custody transition ~6th grade: mom begged dad to take him after Asher split, dad reluctant because of Julie
- Dad: AT&T lineman, 4th wife Julie. Destroyed objects (washer, weedeater) never people.
- Julie: hid Cody in closet from dad's rage, shamed him for hiding in room ("makes dad sad"), tallied cost to feed him, constant "not enough" messaging
- GT/GATE ~6th grade. AP classes. Sea cadets. Football failed ~8th grade (vivid scene: QB pushed him down, dad watching).
- Practicing masking from childhood: handshakes, walking, kissing mirror, caught and called out
- Alcohol introduced by Julie as sleep aid ~6th grade. Started stealing theirs.
- BS CIS University of Houston, graduated Dec 2018. 2.98 GPA attending ~10% of classes.
- Cybersecurity intern Clarkson Aerospace 2015-2018, presented at Pentagon Lab Day
- USMC 2018-2023, Camp Lejeune, Captain, Disbursing Officer
- ADHD diagnosis 2024, ASD recognition Jan 2026
- Cooper born ~March 2025, now 10 months
- Pets: Luna (dog), Stella and Phoebe (cats)

### Key Corrections
- Holes in wall = Cody's, ages 23-26 during worst drinking. NOT childhood, NOT dad's.
- Before that: staring at walls (shutdown, not rage)
- Asher = mom's abusive fiancé, not sibling/friend
- Julie = stepmom (dad's 4th wife), central figure in dad's household
- TV dinners/ice cream = biweekly dad visits, not primary food at mom's
- Lake Livingston = mom's location. "You come back and act better than us" = returning from grandparents' care

### Demi's Honest Assessments (Cody requested, no filter)
1. Extraordinary maps of self, almost no home movies. Frameworks may have replaced some memories.
2. AuDHD framework is real AND can function as a shield against developmental trauma work.
3. Shadow voice framing ("installed, not native") sometimes dismisses valid doubt along with false doubt.
4. Self-regulation is one continuous thread: breath-holding → food withholding → staring → alcohol → music → systems
5. Julie's food cost ledger likely connects to Cody's food withholding
6. Lake Livingston "act better than us" is the template for current dynamic where his difference reads as superiority
7. Care deficit worse than any document captured - he was barely parented
8. Rage goes almost entirely inward. Self-hate is pervasive, outward anger barely mentioned.
9. Football scene is one of few vivid narrative scenes - most memories are states, not scenes
10. "Mature young" is the most dangerous compliment a neglected kid can receive

### Memory Fragments Captured (Cody's brain dump, placed chronologically)
People: Jake, Asia, Karen/Rusty, Lynn/Kenna, Tony (math + pool), Julie, Kelly, Steven Mochel, Stacy (made up)
Places: trailer, McClendon house, Lake Livingston, El Toro, Sonic
Scenes: fire/chemical burns, football failure, sleeping outside, caught reading (books taken), closet hiding, Lynn blocking mom, chemo sessions, skating rink bathroom (jumped), negligent discharge, Naruto before moving to dad's
States: loneliness always, too much/intense, lies everywhere, sitting in stalls during lunch, holding breath 3+ min, food withholding days, repeating playlists, staring at walls

### Gaps Remaining
- Military years (TBS, deployment, negligent discharge, Halloween post-deployment, Thanksgiving 2019)
- How/when met Kendall
- Breaking point leading to 2024 diagnosis
- What Cody wants Tom to understand
- What Cody wants Kendall to hear
- What's hardest to say out loud
- Many bracketed questions throughout doc

### Decisions
- Doc lives in theke/metaxynoesis/therapy-history.md so Cody can edit in Obsidian
- Not a clinical document - honest chronological guide with Demi's questions and observations
- Cody values clarity over validation in this work
- Tom needs felt experience not frameworks - the doc flags this repeatedly
