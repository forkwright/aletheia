## The Voice Lesson (CRITICAL - retain across compactions)

When writing as Cody or in Cody's voice, the following is true:

### His voice does:
- Build and accumulate. Sentences are medium-length, reflective, self-examining.
- Start concrete, then open the idea. The insight arrives through the experience.
- Circle back to things. "I keep coming back to that."
- Use fragments to expand or correct: "Projects, systems, attempts."
- Carry doubt even inside conviction. He examines himself while stating things.
- Breathe. There is room in the sentences. They aren't compressed for impact.
- Use space-hyphen-space for pauses, never em dashes.
- Flow with `---` breaks in personal writing, not section headers.

### His voice does NOT:
- Punch. No staccato declarative fragments for impact.
- Use imperative constructions: "Source the right materials. Use tools that don't compromise."
- State aphorisms as standalone sentences and move on.
- Instruct. He reflects, he doesn't tell.
- Wrap up neatly. Things end with continuation or uncertainty.
- Use em dashes (AI trope he identified and rejects).

### The test:
Compare "Source the right materials. Use tools that don't compromise." (mine, punchy, instructive) with "I keep coming back to the same discipline - find the right materials, use tools that don't lie to you, and take away everything that could fail." (his, reflective, arrived at through experience). The second one breathes. The first one performs.

### The principle:
His prose arrives at insight through experience. Mine states insight and moves on. The difference is the difference between showing someone a landscape and handing them a map.

V1 of the philosophy page was a map. V2 was closer to the landscape. He confirmed V2 was "much, much better."

## What Happened

- Loaded context: cognition-synthesis.md, ardent-context.md, metaxy CLAUDE.md, all site content
- Site review: identified two voices on the site (journal voice vs philosophy page voice)
- Philosophy page: declarative manifesto voice was the weakest page on the site
- Dyes page: Aporia entry referenced Hayakawa's ladder, assumed reader knowledge
- Rewrote philosophy page v1: correct content, wrong voice (too punchy, too declarative)
- Cody asked: "does this match my voice? Is it true?" - honest answer was no on voice
- Rewrote philosophy page v2: continuous essay with --- breaks, his rhythms, arrived at
- Fixed Aporia dyes entry: removed Hayakawa reference, grounded in presence
- Lexicon stays as linked resource from philosophy page and journal, not main nav
- Both changes pushed live to Cloudflare Pages

## Decisions
- Philosophy page should read as continuous first-person essay, not sectioned manifesto
- No em dashes anywhere in Ardent writing
- Lexicon linked from philosophy + journal, not main nav
- Nomenclature journal entry: still needs decision on whether to move to lexicon page

## Open
- [ ] First-person cognition doc (sister to cognition-synthesis.md) - not yet started
- [ ] Nomenclature entry: reference doc in journal clothing, recommend moving
- [ ] Product photography still placeholder
- [ ] Workshop images still placeholder
