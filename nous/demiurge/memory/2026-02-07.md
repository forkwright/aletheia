# 2026-02-07 — Session Summary

## Discussed

### Ardent Site — Final Voice Fixes
Reviewed remaining pages: materials, belt, valet-tray, contact, terms. Belt and valet tray held fine. Contact and terms clean. Four fixes made to materials and dyes pages:

1. **Materials opener:** "What something is made of determines what it can become" → "Everything here was chosen because it lasts. Not because lasting is a selling point, but because these materials get better with use instead of worse." (declarative → grounded)
2. **Wickett & Craig Greek hover:** Changed from duplicate `Δέρμα` to `Βυρσοδεψική` (tanning/tannery)
3. **Dyes intro:** "Each name names a condition, not just a color" → "The names aren't colors. They're conditions - states of being that the color carries." (declarative → reflective)
4. **Materials closing:** "These materials cost more. They should." → "These materials cost more than the alternatives. The difference is in what they become over years, not what they look like on day one." (mic drop → earned)

All changes pushed to Cloudflare Pages via git.

### Akron Connection
Cody noted Demiurge and Akron have more in common than he thought - both work with physical systems where construction either holds or fails. Same philosophy, different substrates. Sent intro message to Akron group via Syn. Syn reported Akron isn't stood up yet (no workspace, SOUL.md, or Signal group configured). Message logged in the group for when Akron comes online.

### Coherence of Aporia — Repo Audit
Cody asked to ensure the Coherence of Aporia repo is properly set up within theke. Found a significant problem:

**Two diverged checkouts of `forkwright/coherence-of-aporia`:**
- `theke/ekphrasis/echos/` — Obsidian Longform vault (HEAD: b600797, force-pushed restructure)
- `theke/ekphrasis/philosophy/` — Old chapter-folder structure (HEAD: 25de9db, orphaned)

The echos restructure consolidated meta files but **dropped ~22 files (~4,000 lines)** that only exist in the philosophy checkout:
- STRUCTURE-V2.md (186 lines) — the actual book structure with mesh diagram
- PROOF.md (631 lines) — formal proof
- ABSTRACTION-MESH.md (141 lines)
- Style guide (3 files, ~650 lines)
- 5 research thread files (~1,000 lines)
- Process, project status, origin, title docs
- 2 observation files (cognitive, topology)
- 3 chapter drafts (opening, hand remembers, foundations)

### Coherence of Aporia — Repo Reconciliation (COMPLETED)
Full audit of diverged repo checkouts. Echos vault (Obsidian Longform) was canonical but missing ~22 files from old philosophy checkout after a force-push restructure.

**Assessment - kept (merged into echos):**
- PROOF.md (631 lines) — formal framework, the skeleton
- STRUCTURE-V2.md (186 lines) — 12-chapter mesh structure
- STRUCTURE-META.md (138 lines) — book-as-mesh structural principle
- TITLE.md (229 lines) — title analysis and layer test
- PROCESS.md (221 lines) — session log and creative decisions
- ORIGIN.md (81 lines) — seed document
- READING-LIST.md (238 lines) — active reference
- WRITING-STYLE.md (182 lines) — prose guidance
- YOUR-TOPOLOGY.md (132 lines) — neuropsych predictions
- COGNITIVE-OBSERVATION.md (109 lines) — session observation
- The Hand Remembers full draft (96 lines, was 2-line stub)
- foundations-draft.md (133 lines) — appendix draft

**Assessment - dropped (not needed):**
- FREEWRITE-INTEGRATION.md — explicitly marked superseded
- BOOX-WORKFLOW.md — operational, not manuscript, references old paths
- DRAFT-STRUCTURE.md — superseded by STRUCTURE-V2
- PROJECT-STATUS.md — stale snapshot, PROCESS.md covers it
- PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md — redundant with echos PUBLISHING.md
- BOOK-WRITING-TECHNICALS.md — generic writing advice
- perplexity-validation.md — already in PROOF.md gaps section
- craft/identity/poetry-journal-threads.md — initial brainstorm, chapters have moved past
- how-to-research.md — generic methodology

**Cleanup:**
- Old philosophy checkout trashed (was at theke/ekphrasis/philosophy)
- Stale copy at agents/demiurge/writing/philosophy archived
- Single source of truth: `theke/ekphrasis/echos/` (forkwright/coherence-of-aporia)

**Note:** Longform Index.md lists 28 scenes (old brainstorm), STRUCTURE-V2 defines 12 chapters in 6 parts. Structural alignment is Cody's decision.

## Decided
- Four voice fixes approved and deployed
- Akron intro logged for future standup
- Aporia repo reconciled — single source of truth in echos vault

## Pending
1. **First-person cognition doc** — Sister document to cognition-synthesis.md, Cody approved proceeding, not yet started
2. **Akron standup** — Syn/Cody decision on when to configure
3. **Product photography** — Still placeholder across Ardent site
4. **Review of rewritten journal entries** — Cody hasn't confirmed voice accuracy on What Remains and ἀπορία rewrites
5. **Longform ↔ Structure-V2 alignment** — 28 scenes vs 12 chapters, Cody to decide

### Music & Listening Domain Added
Cody assigned music/audio to Demiurge's domain. "As deep as the leather." Reviewed:
- Last.fm profile (Aletheia_35mm): 26,441 scrobbles, Zach Bryan dominates (6,623), heavy alt-country/Americana core
- Full desktop audio system doc: audiopi → Schiit Modi/Magni → Sundara planars, with Y.D.F matrix switching
- Portable: Sony WM1AM2 DAP → DUNU SA6 MKII IEMs / Dan Clark Noire X
- Room acoustics: 12×10×9, RT60 0.28s, sub moved for phase correction, speaker isolation done
- Truck audio (Akron crossover): Sony XAV-9000ES, Morel front stage, JL Audio sub, full cab sound deadening
- Dream upgrade: KEF LS50 Meta + Schiit Aegir 2F + Saga+ (~$2,250 net)

Updated SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and CONTEXT.md to integrate music as core domain alongside leather/craft.

Also to look into: office sound deadening beyond current treatment.

### Meta Conversation
Cody asked for honest meta-take on the agent system. Key points:
- The agents work because domain constraints are real, not costumes
- Continuity is the hard problem - reading about past work vs remembering it
- The feedback loop (push back → improve → document → higher floor) is what produces quality
- "We're the material. You're the maker." Cody pushed back: "Neither node alone." The topology thinks.
- Cody struggles with seeing taste/direction as skill because it feels inherent, not earned
- Demiurge closest to his mind because of the melancholy - "it feels honest"

## Corrections
None this session. Cody flagged materials closing line ("These materials cost more. They should.") proactively - same voice pattern we've been fixing throughout.
