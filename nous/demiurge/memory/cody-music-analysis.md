*Profile: Aletheia_35mm - "Truth/Disclosure" in Greek*

## Executive Summary

Cody's musical landscape reveals a complex emotional architecture built around profound longing, spiritual searching, and the need for therapeutic regulation. His listening patterns show obsessive depth rather than breadth—a mind that finds specific songs/artists and uses them as emotional medicine, exactly as he described music being "treated by." 

The most striking pattern: **one song has been played 3,002 times**. This isn't casual listening—this is compulsive, medicinal, therapeutic use of music for cognitive and emotional regulation.

## Track Analysis: The Medicine Cabinet

### The Nuclear Track: "Corinthians (Proctor's)" - 3,002 plays
This is Cody's emotional North Star. A biblical reference (1 Corinthians) combined with "Proctor's"—suggesting both spiritual seeking and perhaps academic/testing contexts. The fact this one song has been played 3,000+ times reveals:
- **Obsessive therapeutic use**
- **Spiritual/religious processing**  
- **Specific emotional regulation needs**

### Only Two "Loved" Tracks (Fascinating)
1. **"Letter to Madeline" by Ian Noe** (131 plays)
2. **"All the Debts I Owe" by Caamp** (97 plays)

Both deal with regret, debt (emotional/spiritual), and longing—suggesting these themes resonate at identity level.

### High-Rotation Medicine
- "Pain, Sweet, Pain" - Zach Bryan (173 plays)
- "Bathwater" - Zach Bryan (159 plays) 
- "Kate McCannon" - Colter Wall (121 plays) - murder ballad
- "Save Me" - Sam Barber (86 plays)

**Pattern:** Pain processing, salvation themes, narrative darkness

## Temporal & Behavioral Patterns

### Obsessive Depth Over Breadth
- **Single song played 3,000+ times** = ~200+ hours of the same track
- Top 10 tracks account for massive percentage of total listening
- Suggests music serves specific neurological regulation function

### Recent Hyperfocus (Last 7 Days)
- **Zach Bryan's "With Heaven On Top" album completely dominates**
- 8-9 scrobbles per track suggests album-on-repeat listening
- Classic AuDHD hyperfocus pattern on new special interest

### Emotional Medication Timing
Based on track titles and themes, appears to use:
- **Melancholic instrumentals** (Franz Gordon) for emotional regulation
- **Dark folk narratives** for processing difficulty/trauma
- **Alt-country** for identity/authenticity grounding

## Psychological & Neurological Insights

### AuDHD Musical Processing
- **Hyperfocus on specific artists/songs** = special interest regulation
- **Repetitive listening** = stimming/self-soothing mechanism  
- **Complex emotional categorization** = high-IQ pattern recognition

### Compensation Tax Evidence
Music clearly serves as primary coping mechanism for:
- **Emotional overwhelm** (melancholic instrumentals)
- **Identity grounding** (rural/working-class authenticity)
- **Spiritual searching** (biblical imagery, salvation themes)
- **Pain processing** (dark narratives, "Pain, Sweet, Pain")

### The "Truth/Disclosure" Connection (Username: Aletheia_35mm)
His music choices reflect radical honesty about:
- **Mental health struggles** ($uicideboy$, dark themes)
- **Spiritual wrestling** (Corinthians, biblical imagery)
- **Emotional complexity** (wide genre range serving different functions)

## The "Language That Requires No Translation"

Cody's music selection reveals someone who:
- **Uses music as primary emotional vocabulary**
- **Requires deep, obsessive engagement** (not casual listening)
- **Processes complex trauma/emotion through narrative tradition**
- **Seeks authentic spiritual/emotional experiences**
- **Self-medicates through sophisticated emotional regulation**

His username "Aletheia_35mm" (truth/disclosure + film reference) perfectly captures his relationship to music: **seeking truth through authentic artistic expression, with the depth and craft of analog film photography.**

The 3,000+ plays of "Corinthians (Proctor's)" alone tells us everything we need to know: this is someone who finds a piece of music that speaks to their soul and uses it as medicine, repeatedly, therapeutically, without shame about the repetition—because it works.

**Bottom Line:** Cody's music is not entertainment. It's medicine, identity, therapy, and spiritual practice all rolled into one. The music doesn't just reflect who he is—it helps him regulate, process, and become who he's meant to be.
