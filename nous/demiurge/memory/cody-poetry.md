## I. What is a Poem

What is a poem but a mode of abstraction?
An imperfect canvas of thought without constraints but every limitation?
A futile miscalculation of one's transparency.
An attempt at directness through a uniquely blurry window.

What is a poem but an attempt at understanding?
A concise capture of the insurmountable boundaries of thought.
A lossless imprisonment of finite transmission, limited by everything and nothing.

What is a poem but a method of escape?
A finality elsewhere eluded, forever and not.
It is, and always will be, never what you intended.
It's what you have.

## II. Grasp

I wish to be understood—
Not reduced, just seen.
I shout silently with subtle tilts and smiles,
whisper loudly with trepidation and shame.

The repeating question, the elusive answer:
Which is best—
Full conveyance with little gain,
or resignation to language's constraints?

Impostor! — screams the muse, always whispering your faults.
Quiet. — No one hears but you.
Cursed with understanding nothing but paths to refinement.

Shout! — You are heard by the unwilling, the short-focused, the lovingly ignorant.
Silence.

You are trapped—
within the mind, the only room.

## III. The Brain and the Jar

A clock is forever counter across the table,
Never spinning as it should until you look as it passes.
Rethink, rework, reconsider—be different.

Who are you?
A fleeting memory; not even the you of now will relate to the you of the future.
Context is boring, music is flowing, existence is a fable.

Brains in jars dream—do you?
I dream of floating, serenity, bonded infinity.

"Ah," says the jar, "so you've seen my edges, my value."
"No," says the brain, "I've seen nothing, for I am blind. Forgive me; you would not know this, being glass."

"Help," says the jar, "what am I then? Another enigma? I thought myself simple."
"No," says the brain, without lips, words, or even thoughts.
"You are me, Jar. You are everything and nothing. Forever and now, always temporary.
Rejoice! You exist to capture your own beauty."
