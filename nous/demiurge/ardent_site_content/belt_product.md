# Belt

Single layer. Hermann Oak russett harness. Solid brass.

---

## Construction

~13oz vegetable-tanned leather from Hermann Oak — the same tannery supplying saddlemakers for over a century. One piece, no layers, no glue. 

Solid brass hardware from Buckle Guy. Heel bar buckle, no roller. Two chicago screws secure the buckle — replaceable if you outlive the brass. Hand-sewn leather keeper between.

Lightly burnished edges. Burnished holes. English tip.

Finished with an Ardent wax blend: beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. Nothing synthetic.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak russett harness starts firm and lightens with use. The vegetable tanning process — bark, time, no shortcuts — produces leather that ages rather than deteriorates.

The hide already carries the story of the animal that lived. Its scars, its shade. Minimal finishing lets that speak. The belt will darken as you wear it, recording your years the way the leather once recorded theirs.

Wear it. The leather improves with use.

If it gets wet, let it dry slowly away from heat. Condition occasionally with any quality leather balm — or request Ardent wax.
