## Hermann Oak Leather

Hermann Oak Leather Company has operated in St. Louis since 1881. They vegetable-tan using oak bark — a process that takes weeks where chrome tanning takes hours.

The difference shows over time. Chrome-tanned leather stays the same until it fails. Vegetable-tanned leather develops patina, darkens with handling, molds to your shape. It ages.

Ardent uses their russett harness leather at ~13oz weight. Heavy enough to hold structure, supple enough to bend without cracking. The surface shows the grain of the original hide — no coating, no correction.

## Solid Brass Hardware

Brass is copper and zinc. It doesn't rust. It oxidizes slowly to a darker patina that can be polished back or left to age.

Plated hardware — zinc or pot metal with a brass coating — looks identical when new. The coating wears through within a few years, revealing gray metal underneath.

All Ardent hardware is solid brass from Buckle Guy. Heel bar buckles, chicago screws, keeper hardware. No plating, no mystery metal.

## Thread

Ritza 20/6 — waxed polyester saddle thread. The industry standard for leather that needs to hold.

Hand saddle-stitching creates two independent thread paths. If one side wears through, the other holds. Machine stitching uses a single interlocked thread — one break and the whole seam unravels.

The keeper is hand-sewn. The belt holes are punched and burnished.

## Finish

Ardent wax: beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. Optional jojoba oil for flexibility.

This protects without sealing. The leather can still breathe, still absorb and release moisture, still age naturally.

Nothing synthetic. Nothing that would need to be stripped and reapplied.

*These materials cost more. They cost more because they're slower to produce, harder to source, and last longer than the alternatives. That's the only reason.*
