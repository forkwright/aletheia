# Dyes

The act of dyeing is not decoration — it's an alteration of the skin itself.

Leather absorbs what you give it. These recipes use historical ingredients: plant matter, mineral mordants, time. The color becomes part of the hide, not a coating on it.

Each name names a condition, not just a color.

## Aima
*Αἷμα — blood*

**Hex: #6D0000**

Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity.

Madder root, logwood, iron mordant. The same pigments that colored Roman boots and British saddlery. True oxbloods fade to rust unless correctly fixed — this one holds.

## Thanatochromia
*Θανατοχρωμία — the color death leaves behind*

**Hex: #40366E**

Imperial purple from sea-snail dye cost fortunes to make. This version channels that legacy through logwood and indigo, muted into shadow by iron.

A coined word. Greek grammar, new meaning.

## Aporia
*ἀπορία — the condition of being stuck between unresolvable truths*

**Hex: #3B4D39**

Green on leather was historically elusive — most faded fast or turned brown. This version borrows stability from copper (verdigris, micro-dosed) and depth from nettle and logwood.

The philosophical condition a wise mind must pass through to grow.

## Process

Botanical matter simmered for an hour. Strained. Iron mordant added gradually — the color shifts as it oxidizes. Applied in thin coats by sponge or wool dauber, dried and buffed between layers.

The mordant fixes the ghost of these colors into the leather's pores. Making memory permanent.

*Hand-dyed pieces are made to order. Expect longer lead times.*
*Pricing varies by piece — the process is the value.*
