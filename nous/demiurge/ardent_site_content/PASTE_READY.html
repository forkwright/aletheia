<h1>Materials</h1>

<h2>Hermann Oak Leather</h2>
<p>Hermann Oak Leather Company has operated in St. Louis since 1881. They vegetable-tan using oak bark — a process that takes weeks where chrome tanning takes hours.</p>
<p>The difference shows over time. Chrome-tanned leather stays the same until it fails. Vegetable-tanned leather develops patina, darkens with handling, molds to your shape. It ages.</p>
<p>Ardent uses their russett harness leather at ~13oz weight. Heavy enough to hold structure, supple enough to bend without cracking. The surface shows the grain of the original hide — no coating, no correction. Tallow-stuffed during tanning — animal fat, not petroleum.</p>

<h2>Solid Brass Hardware</h2>
<p>Brass is copper and zinc. It doesn't rust. It oxidizes slowly to a darker patina that can be polished back or left to age.</p>
<p>Plated hardware — zinc or pot metal with a brass coating — looks identical when new. The coating wears through within a few years, revealing gray metal underneath.</p>
<p>All Ardent hardware is solid brass from Buckle Guy. Heel bar buckles, chicago screws, keeper hardware. No plating, no mystery metal.</p>

<h2>Thread</h2>
<p>Ritza 20/6 — waxed polyester saddle thread. The industry standard for leather that needs to hold.</p>
<p>Hand saddle-stitching creates two independent thread paths. If one side wears through, the other holds. Machine stitching uses a single interlocked thread — one break and the whole seam unravels.</p>
<p>The keeper is hand-sewn. The belt holes are punched and burnished.</p>

<h2>Finish</h2>
<p>Ardent wax: beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. Optional jojoba oil for flexibility.</p>
<p>This protects without sealing. The leather can still breathe, still absorb and release moisture, still age naturally.</p>
<p>Nothing synthetic. Nothing that would need to be stripped and reapplied.</p>

<p><em>These materials cost more. They cost more because they're slower to produce, harder to source, and last longer than the alternatives. That's the only reason.</em></p>

<h1>Dyes</h1>

<p>The act of dyeing is not decoration — it's an alteration of the skin itself.</p>
<p>Leather absorbs what you give it. These recipes use historical ingredients: plant matter, mineral mordants, time. The color becomes part of the hide, not a coating on it.</p>
<p>Each name names a condition, not just a color.</p>

<h2>Aima</h2>
<p><em>Αἷμα — blood</em></p>
<p style="color: #6D0000; font-weight: bold;">■ #6D0000</p>
<p>Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity.</p>
<p>Madder root, logwood, iron mordant. The same pigments that colored Roman boots and British saddlery. True oxbloods fade to rust unless correctly fixed — this one holds.</p>

<h2>Thanatochromia</h2>
<p><em>Θανατοχρωμία — the color death leaves behind</em></p>
<p style="color: #40366E; font-weight: bold;">■ #40366E</p>
<p>Imperial purple from sea-snail dye cost fortunes to make. This version channels that legacy through logwood and indigo, muted into shadow by iron.</p>
<p>A coined word. Greek grammar, new meaning.</p>

<h2>Aporia</h2>
<p><em>ἀπορία — the condition of being stuck between unresolvable truths</em></p>
<p style="color: #3B4D39; font-weight: bold;">■ #3B4D39</p>
<p>Green on leather was historically elusive — most faded fast or turned brown. This version borrows stability from copper (verdigris, micro-dosed) and depth from nettle and logwood.</p>
<p>The philosophical condition a wise mind must pass through to grow.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Botanical matter simmered for an hour. Strained. Iron mordant added gradually — the color shifts as it oxidizes. Applied in thin coats by sponge or wool dauber, dried and buffed between layers.</p>
<p>The mordant fixes the ghost of these colors into the leather's pores. Making memory permanent.</p>

<p><em>Hand-dyed pieces are made to order. Expect longer lead times. Pricing varies by piece — the process is the value.</em></p>
