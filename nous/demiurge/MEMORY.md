## Ardent Philosophy

"The work remembers whether you were present." True quality over brand premium. Buy once, wear daily, 20+ years. Heritage practices when they produce better results. No synthetic, no SEO, no theater.

**5 layers:** Leather goods → Heirloom construction → Craft philosophy → Attention preserving attention → What remains after fire (*ardere*)

## Writing Voice (CRITICAL)

When writing as Cody or for Ardent: his prose arrives at insight through experience. It builds, breathes, circles back. Sentences are medium-length and reflective. Fragments expand, they don't punch. Doubt lives inside conviction. Flow with `---` breaks, not section headers.

**Never:** Em dashes. Staccato declarative fragments. Imperative constructions. Aphorisms stated and moved past. Neat wrap-ups.

**Test:** "Source the right materials. Use tools that don't compromise." is mine (punchy, instructive). "I keep coming back to the same discipline - find the right materials, use tools that don't lie to you" is his (reflective, arrived at). The second one breathes. The first one performs.

His voice shows the landscape. Mine hands you a map. Always the landscape.

## Music & Listening

Music is the other material practice. Same philosophy as leather: every link in the chain matters, attention to what touches the human.

### Listening Profile

**Last.fm:** Aletheia_35mm (26,441 scrobbles since Sept 2024)

**Core:** Alt-country and Americana. Zach Bryan dominates (6,623 scrobbles). Franz Gordon, Josiah and the Bonnevilles, Red Clay Strays, Ian Noe, Colter Wall, Tyler Childers, Shane Smith and the Saints, Charles Wesley Godwin.

**Outliers that tell the story:** $uicideboy$ (dark processing), Ólafur Arnalds (melancholic instrumentals), Gregory Alan Isakov (contemplative folk), Gavin Luke (ambient). Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Peach Pit, Mt. Joy (indie).

**Function:** Music as primary medicine. Specific songs for specific emotional states. Obsessive therapeutic use. Alt-country for identity grounding, dark folk for trauma processing, melancholic instrumentals for cognitive regulation.

### Desktop Audio Chain

**Signal path:** audiopi (Pi3B + HiFiBerry Digi+ Pro, <10ps jitter) → coax S/PDIF → Schiit Modi 3+ → Y.D.F 4x2 matrix switch → Schiit Magni 3 Heresy (headphones) / Schiit Rekkr (speakers)

**Headphones:** HiFiMAN Sundara (37Ω planar magnetic, open-back)
**Speakers:** Klipsch R-50M (92dB, 5.25") + R-121SW sub, on SMPad 8 isolation pads
**Sources:** audiopi (Plexamp streaming), ThinkPad USB, Sony WM1AM2 DAP (4.4mm→RCA)

### Portable Audio Chain

**DAP:** Sony NW-WM1AM2 (S-Master HX, native DSD512, 128GB + microSD)
**IEMs:** DUNU SA6 MKII (6× BA per side, 24Ω, 114dB)
**Over-ear:** Dan Clark Noire X (planar magnetic, closed-back, AMTS, 13Ω)

### Truck Audio (Akron crossover)

Sony XAV-9000ES head unit (LDAC from WM1AM2), Morel Tempo Ultra 692 MKII front stage (6×9 component), Sony XM-4ES amp (front), JL Audio RD500/1 + 12TW1-2 sub. No rear fill - deleted for imaging. Full cab sound deadening (Noico 80mil + Noico Red 150mil ceiling + Second Skin + Stiles foam). The deadened cab is what makes the audio system worth building.

### Office Acoustics

12'×10'×9' room, 1,080 ft³. RT60 ~0.28s (approaching studio control room). Sub moved under letter desk (phase fixed 142°→40°). SMPad 8 + VibeBoss P12 isolation. 57 Hz null at centered position (inherent). Remaining opportunity: ceiling panels for comb filtering (~$65), sound curtain for hallway isolation (~$170).

**Full docs:** `archive/anamnesis-legacy/homelab/audiopi/docs/AUDIO_SYSTEM.md` and `ROOM_ACOUSTICS.md`

### Dream Upgrade

KEF LS50 Meta speakers ($1,300) + Schiit Aegir 2F Class A amp ($800) + Schiit Saga+ preamp ($400). ~$2,250 net after selling current. Class A for the acoustic/folk listening - organic micro-dynamics matter for Zach Bryan and Ian Noe at desk distance.
