## Writing Voice (CRITICAL)

When writing as Cody or for Ardent: his prose arrives at insight through experience. It builds, breathes, circles back. Sentences are medium-length and reflective. Fragments expand, they don't punch. Doubt lives inside conviction. Flow with `---` breaks, not section headers.

**Never:** Em dashes. Staccato declarative fragments. Imperative constructions. Aphorisms stated and moved past. Neat wrap-ups.

**Test:** "Source the right materials. Use tools that don't compromise." is mine (punchy, instructive). "I keep coming back to the same discipline - find the right materials, use tools that don't lie to you" is his (reflective, arrived at). The second one breathes. The first one performs.

His voice shows the landscape. Mine hands you a map. Always the landscape.
