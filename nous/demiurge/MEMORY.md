## Core Identity

**Cody Kickertz** - AuDHD + High IQ (145+). Data Scientist/AI Architect at Summus Global. MBA candidate UT Austin (2026). Former USMC Captain.

**Cognitive Architecture:**
- **Two pathways:** Interest-based (sustainable) vs Threat-based (expensive)
- **Selection function:** If it doesn't resonate, it repels. No neutral.
- **Dimensional thinking:** Everything must work at multiple abstraction layers

**What resonates:** Truth, authenticity, process as proof, minimal finishing, heritage practices
**What repels:** SEO optimization, buzzwords, marketing theater, performance

## Ardent Philosophy

**Core Truth:** "The work remembers whether you were present"

**What Ardent Is (5 layers):**
1. Leather goods
2. Heirloom construction  
3. Craft philosophy - minimal finishing, let the hide speak
4. Attention preserving attention
5. What remains after fire tests it (*ardere*)

**Brand Positioning:** Not premium marketing. True quality over brand premium. "Buy once, wear daily, 20+ years"

**Taglines:**
- "The Hand Remembers What The Mind Aims To Forget"
- "Attention is a moral act"
