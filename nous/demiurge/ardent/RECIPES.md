# Ardent Leatherworks — Recipes

## The Concept

The act of dyeing is not decoration — it's an alteration of the skin itself. Leather takes these ingredients and becomes them.

### Ingredients as History

- **Logwood:** Colonial exploitation, funeral blacks, ink of bureaucratic death records
- **Madder:** Ancient root-blood, the earliest reds for both bridal and burial cloth
- **Indigo:** Extraction labor, bruises of the sky, sacred blue that stains fingertips
- **Nettle:** Sting and cure, humble wildness, fabric for the poor and the dead
- **Verdigris:** Copper decay, the poison of artists, the green of old bronze tomb markers
- **Iron Mordant:** Blood-rust, weapon and wound, earth's bite in the fibers
- **Vinegar:** Preservation and dissolution — a solvent for history itself

### Process

Leather (once skin) absorbs logwood (once tree), madder (once root), and verdigris (once copper) — a chain of mortal matter converging in a single surface.

The mordant fixes the ghost of these colors into the leather's pores, making memory permanent. This process mirrors mummification — except here, we're not preserving from death; death is worn openly.

## Notes

- All dyes are natural plant/mineral based
- Iron mordant is key to color permanence
- Thin coats > thick coats (prevents cracking)
- Cure time matters — don't rush
- Test on scrap first
