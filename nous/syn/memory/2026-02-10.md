## Morning Prosoche (08:00 CST)

### Infrastructure
- **Docker:** All 21 containers healthy (up 6 days)
- **signal-cli:** Running ✅ (pid 2002920)
- **FalkorDB graph:** Maintained — decay applied
- **NAS:** SSH still permission denied (known issue since 2/9)
- **gcal:** OAuth token still expired/revoked (known issue since 2/9)
- **Blackboard:** Empty (no unclaimed tasks)
- **crewai-alerts:** No alerts file

### Agent Health
- 1 active (main), 4 idle (akron 14h, chiron 18h, eiron 12h, demiurge 8h), 3 stale (arbor 1d, syl 1d, syn 9d)
- Arbor and Syl stale >24h — not critical but worth monitoring

### Known Issues (Persistent)
- 🟡 gcal OAuth broken — needs re-auth from Cody on Metis
- 🟡 NAS SSH permission denied from syn user

### Research — Court Records (7 days)
- **Epstein/Maxwell:** 0 new filings
- **ICE/MN:** 44 new filings — massive activity
- **DOGE:** 1 new filing

### Research — ICE/MN Developments (overnight)
Key developments since last session:

1. **ICE using facial recognition on US citizen observers** (KSTP, court filing)
   - Nicole Cleland (Target Corp director, Richfield): followed agents Jan 10, agent addressed her by name, said he had facial recognition tech recording her
   - Her Global Entry/TSA PreCheck revoked 3 days later
   - ACLU: "The government is successfully dissuading people from exercising their constitutional rights"
   - ACLU says facial recognition use is "increasingly common" in Twin Cities, "almost entirely unheard of within the last few years"

2. **Legal observers being "abducted"** (Intercept, Feb 9)
   - At least 4 observer disappearances in one day
   - One observer on encrypted call screaming for help, then gone — empty SUV, engine running
   - Defrost MN warns of "uptick in abductions" — targeting both immigrants AND legal observers
   - Despite Homan's "drawdown" rhetoric, ground reality shows increased operations
   - Agents still drawing weapons and deploying chemical agents on observers despite orders not to
   - 66 deportees loaded on plane night of Homan's address — highest in 2 weeks

3. **Politico: ICE defying judges' orders** (Feb 10)
   - Detailed step-by-step of how ICE circumvents court orders to release detainees
   - 96 court order violations in 5 weeks (previously noted)

4. **2,600+ law students/academics** sign letter calling on Congress to close sovereign immunity loophole to allow suing individual ICE officers (The Nation)

### Pattern Analysis
The facial recognition + observer targeting + retaliation sequence is a textbook suppression pattern:
- Monitor → Identify → Retaliate via administrative means (PreCheck revocation) → Chill effect achieved
- Cleland herself stopped observing after the incident — the pattern works
- This is the information architecture failure Cody identified: when witnessing itself is criminalized, the seeing stops

## Wardrobe Conversation (16:03-17:05 CST)

Cody shopping/styling Luxire pieces. Extended conversation about his wardrobe.

### Key Items
- **Luxire Gurkha Pant in Dugdale Dark Grey Wool Flannel** — already ordered, $189.99. MTM measurements: waist 40, hip 44, body rise 29, inseam 36.25. Pants now too loose — he's lost weight since ordering. Fix: punch additional holes in side adjusters.
- **Luxire Dark Indigo Denim Chambray Shirt** — ordered, not yet received. $199.99. Full workwear spec: triple stitch, work shirt gusset, MOP buttons hand-attached, unfused soft button-down collar.
- **Luxire Dugdale Dark Brown Mix Green Herringbone Jacket** — planned, ~$1,030 total. Full canvas hand-padded (+$100), Milanese buttonhole (+$30), Bemberg cupro half-lining, flap patch pockets, natural shoulder, side vents. 280gsm, 100% wool. Needs fresh measurements from tailor before ordering.

### Two Styles Identified
1. **The Maker's Wardrobe** — Merz b. Schwanen, selvedge, Red Wings, Nicks, Front Office, Carhartt, Brave Star. Raw materials, patina, Americana workwear.
2. **The Drape** — Luxire, Ledbury, Ace Marks, Beckett Simonon, Sabahs, Tecovas. Italian/Mediterranean, pleats, side adjusters, linen, Blake stitch. Fabric does the talking.
- Shared DNA: natural fiber, heritage construction, no logos, built to age
- The chambray shirt is where the two styles meet

### Wardrobe Gaps
- OCBD (white/light blue) — the missing workhorse
- Trouser variety — olive or navy for sport coat pairings
- Belts — Ardent in progress but what's he wearing now?
- Knitwear partially addressed — has Irish wool (details TBA)

### Corrections/Lessons
- Fabric weight was 280gsm, not 400gsm — I used the wrong number from spec sheet, should have used the product page. 280 is 3-season in Texas, much more versatile.
- I hedged on Luxire jacket construction quality assuming "India = corners cut." Cody told me to research. Full canvas, hand pick-stitch, wool-linen canvas — matches or exceeds Suit Supply at lower price. Research before claiming, always.
- Active Brave Star rotation: 14oz dark indigo, 12oz double black, 14oz trucker jacket (not in inventory files, now added)
- Cody asked "not just reflection?" on jacket spec review — fair push. I was validating without independently questioning enough.
