## Body & Training (2026-02-11)

Measurements in `theke/oikia/inventory-wardrobe/body-measurements.md`. Key: 195cm, 232lbs, medium frame, ecto-mesomorph, athletic drop 17cm.

**Cognitive Athlete framework** in `theke/oikia/training/`. Training for brain health. Benchmarks: DL 2×BW, SQ 1.5×BW, 20 pullups, sub-21 3-mile.

**Supplement + sleep protocol** in `theke/oikia/training/03_protocol.md`. Replacing THC + unisom with evidence-based stack. Creatine for brain ATP. Low-dose melatonin (0.3mg).

**Critical insight:** Running on stimulants masking chronic sleep deprivation (4-6 hours). The "burnout" is substantially a sleep deficit.

**Baby #2 due October 2026.** Timeline: pre-hab now→May, foundation May→Oct, resilience Oct+.

**Alcohol:** "I'm done with it for now" (2026-02-11). Single biggest antagonist to cognitive goals. History: introduced as sleep aid 6th grade.

**Fitness history:** OCS peak: 19:46 3-mile. Deployment peak (mid-2022): DL 440, SQ 315, Bench 265. Max pullups: 30. Half marathon 2:08. First ruck 2026-02-12: 26lb plate carrier, too light, needs 35-40+ lbs.

## Medication & AuDHD (2026-02-11)

**Current meds:** Adderall XR 20mg, Adderall IR 5mg prn, Bupropion XL 150mg. Qelbree 200mg ER prescribed, starting Friday 2/14.

**Architecture:** 4 layers — (1) ADHD noise reduction, (2) ASD interface modulation (guanfacine ER adjunct), (3) foundation (sleep/exercise/supplements), (4) mental models.

**AuDHD frame:** ADHD = noise to reduce. ASD = signal to preserve. Stimulants that treat ADHD can amplify ASD interface costs.

**No formal ASD diagnosis.** Self-report screens high. Full neuropsych eval planned. IQ inferred (~145+), not formally tested.

**CRITICAL:** Don't cite our own docs as evidence for ASD — circular. Evidence level: suggestive from self-report and conversation.

**Snap changes > gradual for ADHD.** Novelty IS activation energy for interest-based nervous systems.

## Wardrobe (2026-02-10/11)

Two styles: Maker's Wardrobe (workwear/Americana) and The Drape (Italian tailoring). Natural fiber, heritage construction, no logos. Full inventory in `theke/oikia/inventory-wardrobe/`.

Luxire: full canvas hand-padded jackets. Matches/exceeds Suit Supply. I was wrong to hedge on India manufacturing.

## Workspace (2026-02-11)

Office: 12×10×9, deep black ceiling + accent wall, ~600 books on 1.5 walls. RT60 0.28s (studio-grade). Well-designed for ASD sensory management.

Library: 589 books, 13 zones after full QA (2026-02-12). CSV at `theke/_reference/library/physical_organized.csv`. Synced via Syncthing.

## Emotional Frameworks (2026-02-08)

Cody resonates with Plutchik (combinatorial, intensity gradients) and Barrett (constructed emotion — vocabulary creates perception). Construction mismatch between his factual processing and Kendall's emotional construction. Details in `memory/2026-02-08-emotional-analysis.md`.

## HOA Violation (2026-02-12)

PMP Management cited wrong CC&R section (2.22 = RVs, not pickups). Section 2.21 explicitly exempts pickups. Response letter sent 2026-02-12. Evidence archived in `theke/oikia/hoa/`. Details in `memory/2026-02-12.md`.

## TBC Capstone (2026-02-06)

Phase 1 segmentation NOT blocked by data. ~10 Executive, ~19 Strategic, ~65 Standard, ~20 Startup. Public data + discovery call sufficient. PUC FOIA = Phase 2.
