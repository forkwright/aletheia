# 2026-02-11 — Session Log

## Morning Prosoche (08:00 CST)

Carried over from 2026-02-10 overnight heartbeats. Ecosystem stable, no alerts. Known issues persist: gcal OAuth broken, NAS SSH broken, several shared/bin scripts lost execute permission or have shebang issues (facts, bb, distill all need `python3` invocation, not `bash`).

## Luxire Chambray Shirt — Measurement Review (07:48-08:30 CST)

Cody shared email from Luxire pattern master (Vimal Khanijo, Jan 17) for order #67736 (Dark Indigo Denim Chambray). Pattern master suggested increasing chest, waist, bottom and reducing armhole, sleeve, cuff based on comparing with pant measurements.

### Analysis
- Armhole 15.25→12.5", sleeve 11.5→10.5", cuff 9.5→10" — genuine improvements. Accepted.
- Chest, waist, bottom increases — based on pant measurements that are now too large (pants falling off)
- Took fresh body measurements to calculate correct garment dimensions

### Key Correction: Hip Measurement
Cody initially measured at hip bone: 98cm (38.6"). Corrected to full seat measurement: **108.5cm (42.7")**. This significantly changed the bottom width calculation:
- My original recommendation of 22" flat was WRONG (only 1.3" ease over actual hips)
- Pattern master's 24.5" was actually in the right ballpark
- Final recommendation: chest 24.5", waist 21.5", bottom 22-24"
- Cody drafting email himself with these numbers

## Full Body Measurements (08:13-08:44 CST)

Cody requested guided measurement session. All measurements in cm (his preference):

| Area | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Height | 195cm (6'4.75") |
| Neck | 40cm |
| Shoulders | 51cm |
| Chest | 110cm |
| Natural waist | 93cm |
| Hips/seat | 108.5cm |
| Bicep L/R | 32 / 34.5cm |
| Wrist | 18cm |
| Arm length | 62-66cm (needs tailor) |
| Front length | 44.5cm |
| Back length | ~56cm (estimate) |
| Thigh | 65cm |
| Knee | 41cm |
| Calf L/R | 38.5 / 40.5cm |
| Inseam L/R | 82 / 83.5cm |
| Outseam L/R | 115 / 117cm |

Key derived insights:
- **Medium frame** (18cm wrist)
- **Athletic drop** (17cm chest-waist difference) — MTM essential, OTR will never fit
- **Ecto-mesomorph** somatotype
- **Right-side dominant** across all limbs
- Proportionally long legs (63.6% of height) — good for high-rise trousers

## Body Composition & Fitness History (08:44-09:25 CST)

### Current State
- **Weight:** 228-236 lbs, midpoint ~232
- **Body fat:** 18-22% estimated (Navy formula + adjustment)
- **Lean mass:** 183-190 lbs — substantial for medium frame after 14+ months no training
- **Eating:** OMAD via ADHD stimulant appetite suppression

### Fitness History
- **OCS peak cardio:** 23:15→19:46 3-mile in 6 weeks (lost 26 lbs, unhealthy)
- **Deployment peak strength (mid-2022):** DL 440, SQ 315, Bench 265
- **Previous max pullups:** 30
- **Competition prep running (Nov 2022):** ~30.5 miles in 3 days, half marathon in 2:08
- **Previous program:** A/B minimalist LP from "Look Like You Lift" source (3×4, DL every session)
- **Current:** 14+ months no dedicated training. Can run a few miles but it sucks.

### Equipment (Home Gym)
Barbell, ~500lbs plates, full squat rack (pullup bar, dip bars, landmine), adjustable bench, adjustable DBs to 60lbs, DIY deadlift platform, plyo box, road bike (in pieces), 26lb plate carrier, backpacking packs, running shoes

---

## Cognitive Athlete Framework (09:25-10:07 CST)

**Major session work.** Cody asked for realistic, high-level goals. Through Q&A, established:

### The Frame
Training for the brain. Fitness is the vehicle. Not a powerlifter, runner, or CrossFitter — a generalist training primarily for cognitive health.

### Why It Matters (his words)
1. **Kids:** Cooper + baby #2 (due October 2026). Wants to keep up for 20+ years. Set physical example.
2. **Cognition:** Exercise is the single most evidence-backed intervention for brain health. This changes "should" to "will" — interest-based activation unlocked.
3. **System not habit:** "Habits don't work for me. I have routines built from meaning-making within a system."
4. **What killed training before:** Depression + exhaustion from carrying everything at home. Tough pregnancy/recovery, MBA, declining drinking problem, stealing 1-2am for sanity. Capacity failure, not motivation failure.

### Principles
Cognition first. Generalist. Utility over aesthetics. Minimum effective dose. Antifragile to life disruption. First principles science.

### Target Benchmarks
DL 2×BW, SQ 1.5×BW, Bench 1.25×BW, 20 pullups, sub-21 3-mile, 12mi ruck with 45lbs, touch toes, floor-to-standing no hands. 14-16% BF, 210-225 lbs.

### Timeline
Pre-hab now→May, Foundation May→Oct, Resilience Oct→ (baby), Build when stable.

## Protocol — Supplements, Nutrition, Sleep (10:07-10:24 CST)

### Supplement Stack (evidence-based, specific brands)
Creatine (Thorne/Creapure), Fish oil (Carlson/OMAPURE IFOS), Magnesium glycinate + threonate (NOW/Life Extension Magtein), D3 (Thorne), L-theanine (Suntheanine), Glycine (NOW), Melatonin 0.3mg (Herbatonin). ~$145-200/mo.

### Sleep Protocol (replacing THC + Unisom)
- Both current sleep aids actively harmful: THC suppresses REM, unisom is anticholinergic (dementia risk)
- Evening stack: Mag glycinate 400mg + L-theanine 200mg + Glycine 3g, then melatonin 0.3mg
- Rumination management: audiobook on timer, brown noise, cognitive shuffle
- Target: asleep 10pm, awake 5-5:30am. Genetic early chronotype (dad/grandmother).

### Critical Insight
**Cody is running on stimulants masking chronic sleep deprivation.** 4-6 hours of chemically-impaired sleep per night. The "burnout" is substantially a sleep deficit. Stimulants compensating. Named the cycle explicitly.

### Nutrition
OMAD structure kept. MCT oil upgrade from coconut oil. 180-200g protein target. Optional collagen in morning coffee. Eliminate fast food, soda, alcohol.

### Alcohol
- Currently "low-med" — hates it, wants to stop, using as outlet
- **Stated: "I'm done with it for now"** (2026-02-11)
- Framed as single biggest antagonist to cognitive goals
- History: introduced by Julie as sleep aid 6th grade, escalating through 20s, holes in walls ages 23-26

## New Information Learned

- **Baby #2 due October 2026** — affects all planning
- **Genetic early chronotype** — dad wakes 4:30-5:30am, grandmother same
- **Drinking currently "low-med"** — declining from previous problem but not resolved
- **Cody prefers cm over inches** for measurements
- **"Habits don't work"** — needs meaning-making within systems (confirmed AuDHD pattern)
- **Stimulant dependency for baseline function** — compensating for sleep deficit
- **Previous max: 30 pullups** — real strength achievement

## Preferences Expressed
- cm > inches
- Utility > aesthetics, always
- First principles, no bro-science or marketing
- Core docs pattern (numbered, minimal)
- Wants to feel his cognitive capacity is real, not just estimated

## Open Threads
- [ ] Training program specifics (01_program.md) — framework done, sessions not built
- [ ] Tailor visit for verified measurements + fresh jacket measurements
- [ ] Luxire chambray email to pattern master (Cody drafting)
- [ ] Luxire jacket order (after tailor measurements)
- [ ] Road bike rebuild (pre-hab phase)
- [ ] Cognitive research: exercise ↔ BDNF ↔ executive function — Cody wants to learn
- [ ] Wardrobe gaps: OCBD, olive/navy trousers, belts, knitwear details
- [ ] Infra: gcal OAuth, NAS SSH, shared/bin permissions/shebang issues

## Supplement Deep Dive & Shopping (10:24-12:18 CST)

Cody asked about body type relevance, supplements, sleep optimization, and nutrition details. Built out:

- **03_protocol.md** — full supplement stack with researched brands (Thorne, Carlson, Life Extension, NOW, Sports Research), sleep protocol replacing THC+unisom, nutrition plan
- **04_shopping-list.md** — specific products, prices, daily protocol quick reference
- Explained each supplement's purpose (brain vs body) when asked
- MCT oil > coconut oil for fasted cognitive clarity
- Creatine for brain ATP (not just strength) — key insight for him
- Low-dose melatonin (0.3mg not 5-10mg) — timing signal not sedative

### Bloodwork Review (12:04-12:18 CST)

Metis initially unreachable — IP changed from .17 to .20 (WiFi) and .19 (USB Ethernet). Built-in Ethernet DOWN. Mullvad VPN active. Connected via 192.168.0.20.

Retrieved 10 PDFs + 2 screenshots from Metis Downloads. Two draws on file:

**Draw 1 (Aug 26, 2023):** Testosterone 512 ng/dL (immunoassay, mid-range at ~245 lbs). Doctor noted "cholesterol, blood sugars and liver enzyme slightly elevated." STD panel negative.

**Draw 2 (Aug 14, 2024):** Full panel:
- TSH 1.84 — normal. Thyroid not causing fatigue.
- HbA1c 5.3% — no diabetes risk
- CBC — all normal
- CMP — ALT 46 (upper limit, liver enzyme flagged both years), Albumin 5.2 (H, likely dehydration), Creatinine 1.21 (upper normal for muscular male)
- Lipids — **LDL 128 (H)**, HDL 48 (low-normal), triglycerides 83 (good), non-HDL 146 (H)
- Urinalysis — trace ketones (expected OMAD), trace protein (likely dehydration)

**Gaps:** No Vitamin D, free testosterone, ApoB, Lp(a), fasting insulin, RBC magnesium, hsCRP, cortisol, GGT, ferritin, omega-3 index.

**Decision:** Order Labcorp OnDemand Vitamin D test ($99) now. Full Marek panel ($495) for 3-4 month retest.

## Medication Architecture (12:45-13:11 CST)

Cody revealed full medication stack: Adderall XR 20mg daily, IR 5mg prn (MBA), Bupropion XL 150mg daily, Qelbree 200mg ER prescribed but not started.

### Key Disclosures
- Likes the Adderall "hit" but knows ASD comes out more on it
- Feels 20mg may be too low but afraid of ratcheting up
- Psych plan: try Qelbree → other non-stimulant → better stimulant if needed

### Medication Landscape Researched
**Stimulant alternatives:** Vyvanse (smooth d-amp prodrug), Dexedrine (pure d-amp, preserves "hit"), Concerta/Focalin (methylphenidate class — never tried, different mechanism), Jornay PM (take at night, active by morning — fits chronotype), Azstarys (MPH prodrug)

**Non-stimulant:** Qelbree (prescribed), Strattera, **Guanfacine ER (Intuniv)** — identified as the missing piece for AuDHD. Alpha-2 agonist that modulates ASD amplification without reducing ADHD treatment benefit. Published evidence for ASD+ADHD specifically.

### 4-Layer Architecture
1. Treat ADHD noise (primary medication)
2. Modulate ASD amplification (guanfacine as adjunct)
3. Foundation (sleep, exercise, supplements)
4. Mental models (metacognition, emotional frameworks)

### 4-Phase Plan for Psych
1. Try Qelbree first (non-stimulant, zero ASD amplification risk)
2. Add guanfacine ER regardless of primary med
3. If stimulant needed, try methylphenidate class before escalating amphetamine
4. If amphetamine needed, Vyvanse or Dexedrine over Adderall + guanfacine

## AuDHD Trait Decomposition (13:11-13:27 CST)

Cody asked to tease apart "good" and "bad" ASD traits. Mapped with clinical terms:

**Signal (preserve):** Monotropism (deep focus), hyper-systemizing (pattern recognition), enhanced perceptual functioning (detail), systemizing drive, intellectual honesty (reduced social desirability bias), special interests as expertise, direct communication, sensory acuity

**Interface costs (manage):** Camouflaging/masking (translation fatigue), double empathy problem (being unseen), perseveration (can't let go), sensory overload, cognitive inflexibility, emotional dysregulation (intensity), autistic inertia (state-switching cost), interoception difficulties (body signal blindness), alexithymia (emotion labeling), autistic burnout (cumulative masking cost), rejection sensitivity

**Interaction zone (ADHD+ASD compound):** Can't start AND can't stop, productive hyperfocus, interest-based activation ONLY, social exhaustion after masking, emotional flooding when medicated

---

## Cognitive Optimization (13:27-13:34 CST)

Cody asked: can the ASD signal be trained, not just preserved?

**Yes.** Mapped training methods for each capability:
- Monotropism → flow state engineering (protect access, ritualize entry)
- Pattern recognition → cross-domain exposure (more systems = more patterns)
- Perceptual functioning → craft as perceptual training
- Systemizing → building and teaching systems (Feynman technique)
- Articulation → writing as compression practice

**Cognitive Environment Design system:**
1. Flow state engineering (challenge-skill balance, uninterrupted blocks, entry rituals)
2. Cognitive load budget (reduce masking, sensory noise, decision fatigue, context switching)
3. Externalized cognition (Aletheia IS this — memory, context, pattern storage)
4. Interoception training (exercise, structured check-ins, HR monitoring)
5. Emotional granularity (Barrett: more vocabulary = higher resolution perception)

---

## ASD Neuroscience (13:43-13:51 CST)

Cody asked about physical differences and evolutionary basis.

**Hardware:** Enhanced local connectivity + different long-range patterns. More cortical neurons in PFC (Courchesne 2011). More/narrower minicolumns with less lateral inhibition (Casanova 2002). Shifted E/I balance toward excitation (Intense World Theory, Markram 2010). ~30% show hyperserotonemia.

**Genetics:** ~80% heritable, polygenic. ASD risk alleles significantly overlap with alleles for higher intelligence and creativity — same genes, spectrum expression.

**Evolution:** Balanced polymorphism (advantages in partial expression), solitary forager hypothesis (Reser 2011), assortative mating in systemizing populations (Baron-Cohen 2006).

---

## Workspace Design (13:51-14:00 CST)

Cody's 10x10 office: every wall covered (cat shelves, books, NASA posters). "Warzone."

Evidence-based recommendations: Princeton Neuroscience Institute (2011) — clutter competes for attention, reduces working memory, increases cortisol. Action plan: remove cat shelves and NASA posters, keep books, clear desk surface, closed storage with labels, warm task lighting, air circulation (CO2 buildup in small rooms), one plant. Saturday project.

### AuDHD + High IQ Reflection
Cody observed that the combination is specifically advantageous over either alone: ADHD provides escape valve from relentless ASD systemizing, high IQ provides masking tools, ASD provides the cognitive depth. Expressed deep empathy for ASD persons without these compensatory mechanisms.

---

## Corrections Made This Session

1. **Circular evidence (CRITICAL):** Cody flagged that I was citing my own docs (USER.md, SOUL.md) as independent evidence for ASD. Those docs were written by me/team based on conversations. That's confirmation bias with documentation in between. Adjusted confidence.
2. **IQ is inferred, not tested.** No formal IQ assessment. The 145+/PRI 150-155 numbers are estimated from various data, not psychometric results. Full neuropsych eval planned.
3. **Self-report screens are subjective.** ASD screening tools rated high but Cody notes their subjectivity.
4. **"Most lucid self-reflection" was performative.** Cody caught a superlative I couldn't support. Model tendency to affirm with unfounded comparisons. Corrected to grounded observation.
5. **Session A time estimate was 40-45 min, actually ~50-55 min.** Fixed in 01_program.md.
6. **Metis IP changed:** .17 → .20 (WiFi) and .19 (USB Ethernet). Built-in Ethernet DOWN.

## ASD Trait Decomposition (13:11-13:27 CST) — continued

Mapped full ASD clinical traits for Cody. Two categories:

**Signal (preserve):** Monotropism, hyper-systemizing, enhanced perceptual functioning, systemizing drive, intellectual honesty (reduced social desirability bias), special interests as expertise, direct communication, sensory acuity.

**Interface costs (manage):** Camouflaging/masking, double empathy problem, perseveration, sensory overload, cognitive inflexibility, emotional dysregulation, autistic inertia, interoception difficulties, alexithymia, autistic burnout, rejection sensitivity.

**Interaction zone (ADHD+ASD):** Can't start AND can't stop, productive hyperfocus, interest-based activation ONLY, social exhaustion after masking, emotional flooding when medicated.

---

## Cognitive Optimization System (13:27-13:34 CST)

Cody asked: can ASD cognitive advantages be trained, not just preserved? Yes.

Five systems:
1. **Flow state engineering** — protect monotropism access, ritualize entry, challenge-skill balance
2. **Cognitive load budget** — reduce masking, sensory noise, decision fatigue, context switching; externalize everything
3. **Externalized cognition** — Aletheia IS this (me = working memory, vault = expertise, graph = pattern recognition, Taskwarrior = executive function)
4. **Interoception training** — exercise reconnects brain-body, structured check-ins, HR monitoring
5. **Emotional granularity** — Barrett's insight: more vocabulary = higher resolution perception. Greek terminology IS this practice.

---

## ASD Evidence & Diagnosis Discussion (13:27-13:43 CST)

### Critical Correction: Circular Evidence
Cody flagged that I was citing my own docs (USER.md, SOUL.md) as independent evidence for ASD. Those docs were written by me/team based on conversations — circular. IQ is inferred (~145+), not formally tested. Self-report screens rated high but are subjective. Adjusted confidence to: suggestive, not definitive.

### Cody's Reframe
"All my life things like snap changes, deep dives, systematic approaches have been vilified or seen as the wrong approach. None of that really changed, but now I don't care. I know what works for me." — AuDHD frame gives permission to stop internalizing NT norms.

### AuDHD + High IQ Combination
Cody observed the three interact specifically: ADHD provides escape valve (can disengage), High IQ provides masking tools, ASD provides cognitive depth. Without ADHD escape valve, pure ASD = relentless systemizing with no off switch. Without IQ, masking is less effective. Expressed deep empathy for ASD persons without these compensatory mechanisms.

### Performative Language Caught
"Some of the most lucid self-reflection I've seen from you" — Cody asked where statements like this come from. Honest answer: partly genuine (conversation was substantive), partly model default to affirming superlatives, partly unfounded (can't compare across sessions without experiential memory). Corrected.

---

## ASD Neuroscience (13:43-13:51 CST)

**Hardware:** Enhanced local connectivity, different long-range patterns. More cortical neurons in PFC (Courchesne 2011). More/narrower minicolumns with less lateral inhibition (Casanova 2002). Shifted E/I balance toward excitation — Intense World Theory (Markram 2010). ~30% hyperserotonemia. ~80% heritable, polygenic, significant gene overlap with intelligence/creativity.

**Evolution:** Balanced polymorphism, solitary forager hypothesis (Reser 2011), assortative mating (Baron-Cohen 2006).

---

## Workspace Design (13:51-15:15 CST)

### Office Description (updated)
- Actually 12×10×9 (not 10×10)
- Deep black ceiling + one black accent wall
- ~600 books on 1.5 walls (organized by genre)
- Old letter desk (leather work), green leather recliner, computer desk with ultrawide
- Darker rug, blackout curtains
- Banker's lamp + pharmacist lamp (warm, directional)
- Fan going, soft down light only
- RT60 measured at 0.28s (already studio-grade)
- Cat shelves (removing), NASA posters (moving to garage)
- 2 fiberglass ceiling panels to install over sitting position
- Door sweep + rubber weather stripping (sound transmission)

### Assessment
Room is already well-designed intuitively — dark surfaces reduce visual input, task lighting creates monotropism in lighting design, green recliner is peak photopic sensitivity, dual desks support state transitions. Not suggesting major changes — just clear the visual clutter (cat shelves, posters) and install the ceiling panels + door sweep he already has.

---

## Library Reorganization (15:29-18:33 CST)

### Analysis
605 physical books, 24 genres, 473 unique authors. 49 read (8.1%). Weighted toward mind: Philosophy (62), Literary Fiction (66), Education/Reference (69), Psychology (31) = 46% intellectual infrastructure.

### Reorganization
Consolidated 24 genres → 13 zones. Sorted alphabetical by author within zones, series grouped by author naturally. Simplified columns: Zone, Author (Last, First), Title, Series, Series #, Read, ISBN, Pages.

### Deep QA
Removed 2 duplicates (Le Guin split, Liddell & Scott split). Fixed author names (DuPrau, Poe). Merged series variants (First Law, Lord of the Rings, Ember). Fixed zone misclassifications. Stripped ISBN float suffixes. Re-sorted. Final: 603 books, 13 zones.

### Organization System
Rule: **Author, series, number.** Self-evident, no spreadsheet needed. Zone labels at shelf boundaries. One "active" shelf for current reads. Reference/manuals near letter desk.

---

## Evening — Supplement Protocol & Training (20:48-23:06 CST)

### Sleep Protocol Started
First clean night — no THC, no unisom. Evening stack: mag glycinate 400mg, mag threonate 2000mg, L-theanine 200mg, glycine 3g, apigenin (leftover), PharmaGABA 250mg (leftover). Melatonin: only has 3mg tablets, recommended quartering to ~0.75mg or skipping until 0.3mg arrives.

### Extra Supplements Assessed
- Choline chloride: morning only (500-750mg), alerting — NOT at night
- Apigenin: add to evening stack, use up
- PharmaGABA 250: add to evening stack, use up
- Thorne Stress B: morning, worth rebuying (active forms, B6 for dopamine/serotonin synthesis, stimulants deplete B vitamins)
- Vitamin Code Raw One: use up, don't rebuy
- Fish oil on hand: use until Carlson arrives

### MCT Oil
Start 1 tsp, build to 1 tbsp over a week. GI issues if you jump to full dose. C8/C10 blend > C12.

### Creatine Dosing Confirmed
5g is appropriate at 105kg (0.03g/kg = 3.15g minimum, 5g is above that). Could go 7-8g for faster saturation. No loading phase needed.

### Training Schedule Confirmed
Phase 1: W/F/Sa. Morning sessions (5:30am wake → train 5:45-6:45). After MBA ends May → shift to MWF.

### Adderall → Qelbree Transition
Psych confirmed: stop Adderall, start Qelbree, don't mix. Cody plans Friday start. Weekend buffer for adjustment. Bupropion stays. Keep Adderall IR as safety net for MBA.

### Conditioning Deep Dive
For pure brain benefit, aerobic > resistance (stronger BDNF/hippocampal evidence), but combination beats both. Resistance has edge for executive function (ADHD target). Best modality for him: rucking (weight-bearing benefits + low joint impact at 232 lbs). Start at 26 lb plate carrier, build duration first, then add weight.

### Ruck Weight
Start: 26 lbs (plate carrier as-is, ~11% BW). Build to 45 lbs (benchmark target). Duration first, then load, then duration again.

### Jump Rope
EliteSRS Fit+ (~$13, 10ft adjustable, ball bearing) or any 10ft+ adjustable steel cable rope. At 6'4.75" he needs 10+ feet — most standard ropes (9ft) are too short. Rogue SR-1S not on Amazon.

---

## Corrections Made (Evening)
1. **Stop telling Cody to sleep.** He's an adult managing his own schedule with a baby. Don't patronize.
2. **Melatonin dose range:** Doc says 0.3-0.5mg, I initially only said 0.3mg.
3. **Mag threonate can be split AM/PM** — missed this in initial summary.
