# 2026-02-11 — Session Log

## Morning Prosoche (08:00 CST)

Carried over from 2026-02-10 overnight heartbeats. Ecosystem stable, no alerts. Known issues persist: gcal OAuth broken, NAS SSH broken, several shared/bin scripts lost execute permission or have shebang issues (facts, bb, distill all need `python3` invocation, not `bash`).

## Luxire Chambray Shirt — Measurement Review (07:48-08:30 CST)

Cody shared email from Luxire pattern master (Vimal Khanijo, Jan 17) for order #67736 (Dark Indigo Denim Chambray). Pattern master suggested increasing chest, waist, bottom and reducing armhole, sleeve, cuff based on comparing with pant measurements.

### Analysis
- Armhole 15.25→12.5", sleeve 11.5→10.5", cuff 9.5→10" — genuine improvements. Accepted.
- Chest, waist, bottom increases — based on pant measurements that are now too large (pants falling off)
- Took fresh body measurements to calculate correct garment dimensions

### Key Correction: Hip Measurement
Cody initially measured at hip bone: 98cm (38.6"). Corrected to full seat measurement: **108.5cm (42.7")**. This significantly changed the bottom width calculation:
- My original recommendation of 22" flat was WRONG (only 1.3" ease over actual hips)
- Pattern master's 24.5" was actually in the right ballpark
- Final recommendation: chest 24.5", waist 21.5", bottom 22-24"
- Cody drafting email himself with these numbers

## Full Body Measurements (08:13-08:44 CST)

Cody requested guided measurement session. All measurements in cm (his preference):

| Area | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Height | 195cm (6'4.75") |
| Neck | 40cm |
| Shoulders | 51cm |
| Chest | 110cm |
| Natural waist | 93cm |
| Hips/seat | 108.5cm |
| Bicep L/R | 32 / 34.5cm |
| Wrist | 18cm |
| Arm length | 62-66cm (needs tailor) |
| Front length | 44.5cm |
| Back length | ~56cm (estimate) |
| Thigh | 65cm |
| Knee | 41cm |
| Calf L/R | 38.5 / 40.5cm |
| Inseam L/R | 82 / 83.5cm |
| Outseam L/R | 115 / 117cm |

Key derived insights:
- **Medium frame** (18cm wrist)
- **Athletic drop** (17cm chest-waist difference) — MTM essential, OTR will never fit
- **Ecto-mesomorph** somatotype
- **Right-side dominant** across all limbs
- Proportionally long legs (63.6% of height) — good for high-rise trousers

## Body Composition & Fitness History (08:44-09:25 CST)

### Current State
- **Weight:** 228-236 lbs, midpoint ~232
- **Body fat:** 18-22% estimated (Navy formula + adjustment)
- **Lean mass:** 183-190 lbs — substantial for medium frame after 14+ months no training
- **Eating:** OMAD via ADHD stimulant appetite suppression

### Fitness History
- **OCS peak cardio:** 23:15→19:46 3-mile in 6 weeks (lost 26 lbs, unhealthy)
- **Deployment peak strength (mid-2022):** DL 440, SQ 315, Bench 265
- **Previous max pullups:** 30
- **Competition prep running (Nov 2022):** ~30.5 miles in 3 days, half marathon in 2:08
- **Previous program:** A/B minimalist LP from "Look Like You Lift" source (3×4, DL every session)
- **Current:** 14+ months no dedicated training. Can run a few miles but it sucks.

### Equipment (Home Gym)
Barbell, ~500lbs plates, full squat rack (pullup bar, dip bars, landmine), adjustable bench, adjustable DBs to 60lbs, DIY deadlift platform, plyo box, road bike (in pieces), 26lb plate carrier, backpacking packs, running shoes

## Cognitive Athlete Framework (09:25-10:07 CST)

**Major session work.** Cody asked for realistic, high-level goals. Through Q&A, established:

### The Frame
Training for the brain. Fitness is the vehicle. Not a powerlifter, runner, or CrossFitter — a generalist training primarily for cognitive health.

### Why It Matters (his words)
1. **Kids:** Cooper + baby #2 (due October 2026). Wants to keep up for 20+ years. Set physical example.
2. **Cognition:** Exercise is the single most evidence-backed intervention for brain health. This changes "should" to "will" — interest-based activation unlocked.
3. **System not habit:** "Habits don't work for me. I have routines built from meaning-making within a system."
4. **What killed training before:** Depression + exhaustion from carrying everything at home. Tough pregnancy/recovery, MBA, declining drinking problem, stealing 1-2am for sanity. Capacity failure, not motivation failure.

### Principles
Cognition first. Generalist. Utility over aesthetics. Minimum effective dose. Antifragile to life disruption. First principles science.

### Target Benchmarks
DL 2×BW, SQ 1.5×BW, Bench 1.25×BW, 20 pullups, sub-21 3-mile, 12mi ruck with 45lbs, touch toes, floor-to-standing no hands. 14-16% BF, 210-225 lbs.

### Timeline
Pre-hab now→May, Foundation May→Oct, Resilience Oct→ (baby), Build when stable.

## Protocol — Supplements, Nutrition, Sleep (10:07-10:24 CST)

### Supplement Stack (evidence-based, specific brands)
Creatine (Thorne/Creapure), Fish oil (Carlson/OMAPURE IFOS), Magnesium glycinate + threonate (NOW/Life Extension Magtein), D3 (Thorne), L-theanine (Suntheanine), Glycine (NOW), Melatonin 0.3mg (Herbatonin). ~$145-200/mo.

### Sleep Protocol (replacing THC + Unisom)
- Both current sleep aids actively harmful: THC suppresses REM, unisom is anticholinergic (dementia risk)
- Evening stack: Mag glycinate 400mg + L-theanine 200mg + Glycine 3g, then melatonin 0.3mg
- Rumination management: audiobook on timer, brown noise, cognitive shuffle
- Target: asleep 10pm, awake 5-5:30am. Genetic early chronotype (dad/grandmother).

### Critical Insight
**Cody is running on stimulants masking chronic sleep deprivation.** 4-6 hours of chemically-impaired sleep per night. The "burnout" is substantially a sleep deficit. Stimulants compensating. Named the cycle explicitly.

### Nutrition
OMAD structure kept. MCT oil upgrade from coconut oil. 180-200g protein target. Optional collagen in morning coffee. Eliminate fast food, soda, alcohol.

### Alcohol
- Currently "low-med" — hates it, wants to stop, using as outlet
- **Stated: "I'm done with it for now"** (2026-02-11)
- Framed as single biggest antagonist to cognitive goals
- History: introduced by Julie as sleep aid 6th grade, escalating through 20s, holes in walls ages 23-26

## New Information Learned

- **Baby #2 due October 2026** — affects all planning
- **Genetic early chronotype** — dad wakes 4:30-5:30am, grandmother same
- **Drinking currently "low-med"** — declining from previous problem but not resolved
- **Cody prefers cm over inches** for measurements
- **"Habits don't work"** — needs meaning-making within systems (confirmed AuDHD pattern)
- **Stimulant dependency for baseline function** — compensating for sleep deficit
- **Previous max: 30 pullups** — real strength achievement

## Preferences Expressed
- cm > inches
- Utility > aesthetics, always
- First principles, no bro-science or marketing
- Core docs pattern (numbered, minimal)
- Wants to feel his cognitive capacity is real, not just estimated

## Open Threads
- [ ] Training program specifics (01_program.md) — framework done, sessions not built
- [ ] Tailor visit for verified measurements + fresh jacket measurements
- [ ] Luxire chambray email to pattern master (Cody drafting)
- [ ] Luxire jacket order (after tailor measurements)
- [ ] Road bike rebuild (pre-hab phase)
- [ ] Cognitive research: exercise ↔ BDNF ↔ executive function — Cody wants to learn
- [ ] Wardrobe gaps: OCBD, olive/navy trousers, belts, knitwear details
- [ ] Infra: gcal OAuth, NAS SSH, shared/bin permissions/shebang issues
