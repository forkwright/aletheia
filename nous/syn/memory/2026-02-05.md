# 2026-02-05 — Prosoche Rename + Concept Audit + Cleanup

## Session Summary

Cody flagged two issues: (1) prosoche rename was incomplete causing a crash, (2) git repo tracked finance CSVs and logo. Fixed both, then expanded into a full concept audit and system cleanup.

## What Was Done

### Prosoche Rename Completion
- Cody fixed the immediate crash from Metis (runtime template HEARTBEAT.md → PROSOCHE.md)
- All 7 agent YAML templates: `heartbeat_checks` → `prosoche_checks`
- `mcp-memory.json`: `heartbeat_interval` → `prosoche_interval`, 30m → 45m
- Removed stale `nous/demiurge/HEARTBEAT.md`
- Historical memory files left as-is (accurate for their time)
- `HEARTBEAT_OK` token unchanged (runtime ack detection)

### Repo Hygiene
- 15 Relay bank CSV exports removed from git tracking (gitignored, files stay on disk)
- `ardent-logo-draft.svg` removed from tracking
- `assembled-context.md` gitignored (generated per-session)
- `*.svg` added to gitignore

### Concept Audit (62 files)
All active files purged of pre-Aletheia naming:
- `moltbot` → `aletheia` (paths, ecosystem name)
- `/clawd/` → `/nous/syn/` (Syn's workspace path)
- `clawdbot` → `openclaw` (CLI references)
- All 7 AGENTS.md + PROSOCHE.md regenerated via `compile-context`
- TOOLS.md regenerated via `generate-tools-md`
- `letta-agents.json` workspace paths updated
- `tools.yaml` patch path fixed
- Predictive cache, blackboard messages fixed

### Scripts Fixed
agent-health, agent-digest, agent-status, auto-status, bb-dispatcher, cleanup-sessions, eiron-deadline-check, letta-populate, mba, memory-consolidation, pre-compact, research, task-send, temporal-graph, weekly-review, work

### Obsolete Scripts Removed
- `clawdbot-watchdog` (superseded by aletheia.service)
- `restore-clawdbot` (superseded by aletheia.service + patch-runtime)
- `patch-clawdbot` (superseded by patch-runtime)

### Archive & Cleanup
- `nous/syn/crewai/` → archive (5.4G venv deleted, code preserved)
- Old transition docs → archive (filesystem plans, old architecture, stock openclaw docs)
- `TOOLS-INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `TOOLS-COMMON.md`, `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` → archive
- `ardent-stripe-webhook` (180M), `ardent-site` (7M), `a2z-tree-site` (39M) → projects/ with symlinks back

### Crontab Migration
All cron jobs pointed to `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/` paths. Rewrote entire crontab:
- `PATH` set at top to include `shared/bin/`
- All paths updated to Aletheia
- Added `graph-maintain` (was only in OpenClaw cron, now in system cron too)

## Body Check Results
- Service: 🟢 active
- Memory: 4.5G/15G
- Syncthing: idle, 61K files, 0 need
- nous/: 24M total (down from ~250M)
- Graph: 396 nodes, 531 rels
- Facts: 311
- ⚠ decluttarr unhealthy, McRae ROI overdue

## Commits
- `589d04b` — prosoche rename sweep + repo hygiene
- `e8849c2` — concept audit: purge moltbot/clawd/clawdbot (62 files)
- `9b00c2b` — cleanup: archive obsolete, move projects out of nous/

## Session 2 (post-compaction continuation ~19:15-19:47)

### Phase 6: SOUL.md Audit — COMPLETED
All 7 nous reviewed. Test: "if you removed all operations, would you still know this person?"
- **Arbor:** Heaviest rewrite (226L→72L). Business details, build phases, logo direction, judgment protocol → template. Character: steady builder who holds two registers.
- **Syl:** Rewritten from 2nd person instructions to 1st person character. Added σύλληψις etymology. Task lists → template.
- **Chiron:** Trimmed "Systems I Maintain" and task routing. Core character retained.
- **Eiron:** Class schedule → template. Signal/Theater/Gold stays (it's how he thinks).
- **Akron:** Domain inventory (vehicle specs, radio, power, prep supplies) → template. Verification principle stays (it IS who he is).
- **Demiurge:** "Who Cody Is" file-read instruction removed. Minor.
- **Syn:** Already clean. No changes.

### RESCUE.md Rewrite
Full rewrite: local fork with all 8 patches, complete cron schedule, Syncthing, external deps, recovery steps.

### README.md Created
What Aletheia is, concept mapping table, architecture sketch, pointer to RESCUE.md.

### Aletheia-Native Concept Pass
Templates: 'agents'→'nous' in all prose. 'heartbeat'→'prosoche' in scripts/docs. CLI args and OpenClaw protocol unchanged (interface contracts).

### Correction: --agent → --nous
Cody caught me treating our own CLI arguments as upstream constraints. "Why can we not change the arguments themselves?" He was right — we wrote these scripts. The boundary didn't exist. Pattern to watch: applying rules vs understanding concepts.

### Tooling Audit (sub-agent)
Spawned sub-agent to audit all 78 scripts in shared/bin/. Results at memory/tooling-audit.md:
- 13 CORE, 17 to CONSOLIDATE, 12 to ARCHIVE, 8 to RENAME
- Major duplicates: consolidate-memory/memory-consolidation/consolidate-session, extract-facts/bulk-extract-facts/mine-memory-facts/extract-insights

### Resume Consolidation
Final `202602-Kickertz_Resume.odt` from Metis → `theke/career/`. 11 old versions removed. Kept: military TRS, capstone team resumes, McCombs templates.

### Syncthing Metis Fix
Metis was 61K files behind — permissions issue (syn couldn't write to /home/ck/aletheia). Fixed: chown syn:ck, chmod g+w, setgid on dirs. Symlink /home/syn/aletheia created. Now syncing (4.6K remaining at last check).

### McRae ROI
Marked done in Taskwarrior (was long completed).

## Commits (full day)
- `589d04b` — prosoche rename sweep + repo hygiene
- `e8849c2` — concept audit (62 files)
- `9b00c2b` — cleanup: archive obsolete, move projects
- `7d494aa` — cleanup round 2: ghost, stragglers, demiurge, vehicle venvs
- `3dc2612` — Phase 6: SOUL.md audit
- `b76d21a` — RESCUE.md + README.md + concept pass

## Open Threads
1. **--agent → --nous rename** across all shared/bin/ scripts (approved)
2. **Tooling consolidation** from audit (78→~57 scripts)
3. **Integration test** — boot each nous with new SOULs, verify
4. **Token optimization** — measure per-session injection, trim
5. **distill session-state.yaml bug** — YAML parsing fails when focus value contains colons/special chars. Needs quoting fix in distill script.
6. **Syncthing pull errors** — 149 pre-fix errors should clear next cycle, verify
