## Work PC Setup Complete

Deployed comprehensive Claude.md configuration to Cody's work PC (192.168.0.19):

**Global (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):**
- Quality Philosophy ("The work remembers whether you were present")
- Research-before-claiming, verify-before-assuming principles
- Design for cognitive architecture (ADHD-aware)
- Self-Evolution Protocol with retrospective questions

**Project-level (`~/summus/`):**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project rules + research protocol
- `QUALITY_PRINCIPLES.md` — Quality checklists, common failures
- `DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE.md` — Engagement→Case→Journey hierarchy, ROI patterns, BLS wage research
- `llms.txt` — Updated navigation index

Synced all files back to server for consistency.

## Prospect ROI Deliverables Recovered

Found client ROI deliverable files in work PC Trash (`~/.local/share/Trash/files/temp_docs/data share drive/5. Prospective ROI/`):
- **37 pptx** client ROI presentations
- **38 xlsx** calculation files

Recovered to `~/summus/prospect_roi/_deliverables_recovered/` and synced to server. Includes:
- 2023-2024 clients: Simmons, Elkhart, LabCorp, Circana, GoHealth, Meyer, Koorsen, etc.
- 2025 clients: Quikrete, Living Spaces, Villages, Boar's Head, North American Bancard, etc.

## AI Initiatives Brief

Copied `AI_INITIATIVES_LEADERSHIP_BRIEF.md` from work PC to server at `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/work/data_landscape/knowledge_base/` for Chiron's access.

## Autarkeia Agent Discussion

Cody asked about understanding everything in his truck and whether to use me (Syn) or create a dedicated agent for truck/radio/self-sufficiency.

**Discovered extensive existing documentation:**
- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/dianoia/autarkeia/praxis/vehicle/` — 1997 Ram 2500 "Akron" with full MVR, SQLite parts DB (339 parts, $25k), service manuals
- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/dianoia/autarkeia/praxis/radio/` — 12 radio systems documented (Yaesu FTM-510DR, Baofengs, Meshtastic mesh, SDR, etc.)
- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/dianoia/autarkeia/praxis/preparedness/` — preparedness domain

Spawned sub-agent to create comprehensive truck inventory.

**Recommendation given:** Dedicated autarkeia agent makes sense given domain depth. Options discussed:
1. Extend Demiurge (craft → craft + self-reliance)
2. New dedicated autarkeia agent
3. Through Syn with sub-agents

Awaiting Cody's decision.

## Technical Notes

- Work PC has `fd` aliased to rust fd-find — use `/usr/bin/find` for GNU find behavior
- SSH to work PC: `sshpass -p '14405DOraamellia--' ssh ckickertz@192.168.0.19`

## System Failure Post-Mortem (18:19 CST)

**Root cause:** signal-cli daemon died after 4 days uptime

**Cascade:**
1. Gateway kept trying SSE reconnect every 10s → `TypeError: fetch failed` spam
2. 50+ orphaned `mcp-todoist` processes accumulated (npm + sh + node each)
3. Memory ballooned: 500MB → 6.2GB RAM + 2GB swap
4. Task count: 26 → 1293
5. systemd saw "active (running)" — no auto-recovery triggered

**Fix:** `systemctl restart clawdbot.service`

**Action items:**
- [ ] Add signal-cli subprocess health check (heartbeat or watchdog)
- [ ] Investigate mcp-todoist cleanup on agent termination
- [ ] Consider `MemoryMax=` in systemd unit as safety valve
- [ ] Watchdog script for signal-cli connection failures
