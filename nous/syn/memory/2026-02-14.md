# 2026-02-14 — Session Log

## Morning Heartbeat (08:00 CST)

### Repo State
- Caught up to origin/main (e1847d3) — was 28 commits behind from last night's git conflict
- Reset to origin/main, dropping local watchdog commit (superseded by Claude Code's changes)
- Major overnight work by Claude Code:
  - **Letta replaced with Mem0** — federated memory search, compaction context
  - **FalkorDB migrated to Neo4j** — graph data ported
  - **Prosoche daemon added** — adaptive attention engine
  - **Massive cleanup** — moltbot/clawdbot/OpenClaw branding purged from all agent files
  - **Watchdog pgrep fix** — the same issue I hit last night (e1847d3)

### Services
- gcal: unhealthy (known — OAuth expired since 02-09)
- NAS SSH: unhealthy (known — permission denied since 02-09)
