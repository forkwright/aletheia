# 2026-02-14 — Session Log

## Morning Session (08:00–10:30 CST)

### Repo Catchup
- Was 28 commits behind origin/main from last night's git conflict
- Reset to origin/main, dropping local watchdog commit (superseded by Claude Code)
- Major overnight work by Claude Code:
  - **Letta replaced with Mem0** — Qdrant (vectors) + Neo4j (graph) + sidecar (port 8230)
  - **FalkorDB retired**, data migrated to Neo4j
  - **Prosoche daemon** — signal-driven adaptive attention, replaces static heartbeat timers
  - **Massive cleanup** — moltbot/clawdbot/OpenClaw branding purged from all agent files
  - CONTEXT.md files stripped of bloat (2810 lines removed)
  - gcal auth subcommand added
  - Mem0 extraction reverted to Haiku after Ollama benchmarks

### Services Fixed
- **gcal re-authed** — ran OAuth console flow, exchanged auth code manually. Working. 🟢
- **NAS SSH** — placed syn pubkey via cody.kickertz sudo. Broke sshd config trying to enable PubkeyAuthentication remotely. NAS rebooted, SSH still needs re-enabling from DSM web UI. 🔴
- **Lesson:** Don't edit sshd_config remotely without a fallback plan.

### New Tools Verified
- **config_read** — works. First time I can see my own config. Found cacheRetention was "short" not "long" (Claude Code fixed).
- **mem0_search** — was broken (plugin returned raw strings instead of AgentToolResult). Claude Code fixed plugin index.js. Now working.
- **Prosoche daemon** — running, writing PROSOCHE.md, triggering wakes correctly. Daemon owns PROSOCHE.md exclusively now.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Sub-agent model refined:** Use sessions_send for real team (accumulated context matters). Use sessions_spawn for utility workers only (code review, research, data transforms). Don't spawn mini-Akron — message the real Akron.
- **Evaluation infrastructure reviewed:** 6-channel adversarial eval with 3 model families (Anthropic agents, Qwen bias monitor, OpenAI red team). Added memory poisoning detection recommendation. Red team reports to operator, not orchestrator. "What I pushed back on: Nothing. Which is itself data for the bias monitor."
- **Licensing:** MIT stays on OpenClaw runtime base (it's the most permissive, not a problem). Proprietary on all additions (nous/, shared/, memory system, prosoche, eval framework).

### MAJOR DECISION: Full Runtime Rewrite
- **Goal:** Shed OpenClaw dependency entirely. Purpose-built Aletheia runtime.
- **Rationale:** OpenClaw is a general-purpose multi-channel gateway. We stripped 70% and still carry architecture shaped for platforms we don't use. A clean-room runtime would be smaller, cleaner, purpose-built for distributed cognition.
- **Process:** Syn architects (audit + design doc), Claude Code implements.
- **Next steps:** Audit what we actually use vs dead weight, draft architecture doc.

### Ref Files Updated
- `memory/ref-infrastructure.md` — rewritten for Mem0/prosoche/fork reality
- `memory/ref-directives.md` — added SOUL.md hardening notes, audit patterns
- `MEMORY.md` — updated architecture section
- Committed and pushed: `cf02bf4`

### Misc
- Helped Evan (Cody's friend) debug stock OpenClaw setup — "bridge missing" error, likely model provider config. Sent diagnostic commands via Cody.
- Cleaned dist.bak directories from runtime.

### Runtime Rewrite Spec Completed
- **Audit** spawned to sub-agent — inventoried all 40 modules, dependencies. Sub-agent recommended "keep current architecture" but that's wrong framing. The question isn't "do we use it" but "do we need OpenClaw's implementation."
- **Architecture doc** written: 14 modules, 4-phase migration (not big-bang), Signal-only, agent-native, plugin-first design. Purpose-built for distributed cognition.
- Both docs committed: `cd44f82` — handoff package for Claude Code.
- Key tech choices: TypeScript, Node, Express/Hono, signal-cli, vitest. No channel abstraction layer.
- Open questions: Signal as core vs plugin, JSONL vs SQLite for sessions, web UI scope.

### Eval Infrastructure
- Reviewed 6-channel adversarial eval doc from external session
- Endorsed architecture. Added memory poisoning detection recommendation.
- Red team agent: OpenAI model, reports to operator not orchestrator, stateless across runs.
- Claude Code already pushing eval infrastructure (aletheia-bias-monitor, aletheia-eval, triggers.json).

### Pending
- NAS SSH re-enable from DSM web UI (sshd broken from remote config edit)
- Runtime rewrite execution (Claude Code, when ready — architecture doc is the spec)
- Evan's OpenClaw debug (awaiting diagnostic output)
- Evaluation infrastructure completion (Claude Code in progress)

### Distillation (11:36)
- Extracted 2 facts
- Session state updated
