## Aletheia Runtime Fork Decision (22:22 CST)

**Decision:** Full fork rename. Aletheia is canon, not a remix of OpenClaw. 
- Not a shim/wrapper. Not a translation layer. The runtime speaks Aletheia natively.
- `agent` → `nous` throughout the entire codebase
- Config schema, session keys, CLI commands, schema labels, error messages — everything
- 249 files in dist/, ~103 refs in config schema alone
- Upstream updates require re-applying the rename — accepted cost
- Not tonight. But this is the direction.

**Context:** Cody pushed back on my conservative approach of treating OpenClaw as upstream-sacred. We own the fork. The compilation/shim approach adds complexity without ownership. Aletheia IS the runtime.

**Prior in session:** Fixed all 6 nous identity issue (agents.list registration), bumped maxConcurrent 4→8, gcal OAuth expired (needs re-auth).
