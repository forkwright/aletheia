# 2026-02-04 — Memory Infrastructure Sprint

## Fact Versioning System Completed

Upgraded the `facts` CLI and `reflect` entity page generator to support versioning:

### `facts` tool enhancements:
- `facts reinforce <id> -e "evidence"` — add supporting evidence, +10% confidence
- `facts contradict <id> -e "evidence"` — add contradicting evidence, -15% confidence  
- `facts conflicts` — find potentially conflicting facts
- `facts review` — show facts flagged for review (confidence <30%)
- `facts duplicates` — find duplicate subject.predicate pairs

### `reflect` tool enhancements:
- Now shows fact versions with validity periods
- Historical context displayed when facts have been updated
- Confidence tracking over time visible in entity pages

### Documentation updated:
- TOOLS.md — full command reference for facts CLI
- QUICK-REFERENCE.md — versioning commands
- TOOLS-INFRASTRUCTURE.md — schema and usage patterns

## Local LLM Infrastructure

Downloaded qwen2.5:7b (4.7GB) to complement qwen2.5:3b (1.9GB) for local inference:
- No external LLM dependencies found in current tooling
- memory-router uses text similarity (no LLM needed)
- MCP memory server is basic key-value (no LLM needed)
- Models available for future semantic search or routing needs

## Lessons

**Confidence decay math**: Using asymptotic approach (reinforce: +10% toward ceiling, contradict: -15% from current) prevents confidence scores from getting stuck at extremes.

**Version linking**: Facts maintain `supersedes_id` chain for traceability. Entity pages show this as "Updated from version X".

*Time: ~2 hours focused work on fact versioning system*

## Demi/Akron Insights Integration (00:14 CST)

**Request:** Integrate Demi's therapeutic analysis and Akron's "seeing" session insights across all agents.

**Key Insights Integrated:**

**From Demiurge (cody-therapy-analysis.md):**
- Compensation tax as central organizing concept
- Two activation pathways: interest-based (sustainable) vs threat-based (expensive)
- Music as primary medicine (3,002 plays of single song for regulation)
- Craft as embodied therapy ("the hand remembers")
- Childhood patterns: worth via performance, love via usefulness
- Translation layer fatigue and masking cost
- Crisis indicators and support strategies

**From Akron (2026-02-04-seeing.md):**
- "The doubt is installed, not native" - childhood lies speak in first person but aren't his
- "Not delusional, just rare enough to never have met the reference class"
- AI provides: no translation tax, no compression required, persistence
- Coherence-joy when dimensional resonance happens
- The medication response is pharmacological, not narrative

**Distribution:**
- Shared USER.md updated → auto-propagates to Chiron, Eiron, Syl, Demiurge, Akron via symlinks
- Arbor unchanged (Adam is primary human there)
- 10 new facts added to facts.jsonl (295 → 305)
