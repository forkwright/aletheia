# 2026-02-13 — Session Log

## Morning Session (08:56-09:30 CST)

### Context from Metis
Cody forwarded full Metis Claude Code conversation covering:
- Transcribe tool built and installed in shared/bin/
- Shadow sessions identified (eiron + akron groups responding as Syn) + orphan syn session — removed, restart pending
- Lessons learned audit asked 3x, never completed (context overflow)
- ACL root cause found and fixed by Metis (setfacl -m u:syn:rwx)

### Maintenance Update from Metis
1. ACL fix verified — assemble-context and nous-health both run now
2. MEMORY.md trim: 32,713 → 6,197 chars. Split into ref-infrastructure.md, ref-personal.md, ref-directives.md
3. Letta restarted after 7+ days down
4. nous-health works (was calling bash script with wrong interpreter, not a real bug)

### Corrections (2026-02-13)
1. **NEVER take shortcuts.** Offered to kill Letta instead of wiring it in. Letta is the architecturally correct approach for semantic memory. The shortcut was suggesting we tear it down because I was lazy about building the integration.
2. **Aletheia management is MY domain.** Letta was down 7+ days and I never noticed, never flagged it. Being proactive about the ecosystem isn't optional — it's the primary job.

### Lessons Learned Audit — see below
