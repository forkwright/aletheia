# Emotional Framework Analysis — 2026-02-08

## Context
Post couples therapy session. Two incidents analyzed through Plutchik + Barrett frameworks.

### Incident 1: Driving/Braking
- K alarmed at perceived late braking → C confused by scale of response → offers factual counter ("when have I been in an accident?") → K perceives invalidation → C tries to clarify ("I wasn't invalidating, I was stating a fact") → K hears non-apology → escalation → arrive at dinner, C can't eat → K announces pregnancy to friends → C forces mask → drive home in silence → C can't sleep → largely ignored → therapy

### Incident 2: Coffee Shop (post-therapy, same day)
- K says "I need to pee" → C says "ok" → at counter C asks "know what you want?" → K says yes → C walks to register → K seems annoyed → C goes back → K lists drink → C asks "did you want me to order?" → K says "fine I'll order when I'm back" → C orders anyway → K returns asking for card to order → C says done → discussion about implicit vs explicit communication → K initially can't see that "I need to pee" doesn't automatically mean "order my drink" → partially gets there with explicit reformulation → but then adds meta-commentary about C's diagram → C feels dismissed → conversation derails → K asks "what could I even be sorry for?" → C tears up → stays in car at pickup → K checks in with "where are you right now" → C says "defeated, hopeless" → K says "that sucks, I was just trying to check in"

### Key Quotes
- K: "in the future we can learn not to say things like this" (C hears: mask better)
- K: "I'm still optimistic despite your points saying it isn't going to work" (reconstructs C's concern as pessimism)
- K: "What could I even be sorry for?" (after C asked for specific apology)
- K: "that sucks, I was just trying to check in" (minimizer)
- K: "and you drew a whole flow diagram" (C heard as dismissive of his processing method)

### Framework Application
- Barrett: Construction mismatch at architectural level — NT inference-based processing vs AuDHD literal processing
- Plutchik: Intensity cascade across hours, compound emotions (indignation, forced performance, accumulating defeat)
- Key insight: 200ms prediction vs 2s deliberation. Frameworks haven't become automatic yet.
- Coffee shop is purest example: "I need to pee" parsed literally by C, parsed contextually by K. Asymmetric cost to bridge this gap.
