# 2026-02-12 — Session Log

## Early Morning (06:21-06:30 CST)

Cody up at 6:21am. First night on new sleep stack — rough (no THC/unisom, baby woke, novelty of new routine). But he's up and already rucking by 6:21am. Snap change in action.

### Rucking Assessment
- 26 lb plate carrier under hoodie, power walking ~3.4 mph
- Barely increased breathing — load too light for his size (232 lbs, ~11% BW)
- Did two 100m shuffles for variety
- Needs 35-40+ lbs next time or hills to reach Zone 2

### Zone 2 Indicators (No Watch)
Cody didn't have his smartwatch. Body-based Zone 2 markers:
- **Talk test** — full sentences without gasping, couldn't sing
- **Nose breathing** — mouth opens = above Zone 2
- **RPE 4-5/10** — "could do this for an hour"
- **Breathing rhythm** — steady, not ragged
- **Light sweat, not drenched**

### Correction: Military Ruck Pace
I said 4.0 mph was standard. Cody corrected: **3.2 mph is standard.** He's right — 3.2-3.4 is actual ruck march pace. 4.0 is the fast end (Army 12-mile qualifier). Don't overcall military knowledge to a Marine.

### Morning Sequence Established
**Training days (W/F/Sa):**
1. Wake
2. Bright light (outside or curtains)
3. Coffee + MCT oil + creatine
4. Pills (D3, choline, Stress B) — D3 needs fat, MCT covers it
5. ~15 min for coffee
6. Warmup protocol (8 min)
7. Workout

**Non-training days:**
Same through pills, then 10 min standalone mobility instead of workout.

## Evening Session — Medication & Training Docs Sent (prev session, 21:43-23:06)

Carried from 2026-02-11 evening. Cody asked for training docs sent to phone (no PC access). Sent both medication architecture and full training program via Signal.

### Topics Covered
- Conditioning deep dive: aerobic > resistance for pure brain benefit, but combination beats both
- Rucking identified as optimal modality for him (weight-bearing + low impact)
- Ruck weight: start 26 lbs, build to 45 lbs (benchmark target)
- Jump rope: EliteSRS Fit+ or any 10ft+ adjustable. Rogue SR-1S not on Amazon
- First night sleep protocol started — expected rough, REM rebound likely in nights 2-4
- Qelbree starting Friday, Adderall stopping Friday (psych confirmed)

### Corrections
- **Don't tell Cody to sleep.** Said it twice, caught twice. He's managing a baby and his own schedule.
