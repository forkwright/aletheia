# 2026-02-12 — Session Log

## Early Morning (06:21-06:30 CST)

Cody up at 6:21am. First night on new sleep stack — rough (no THC/unisom, baby woke, novelty of new routine). But he's up and already rucking by 6:21am. Snap change in action.

### Rucking Assessment
- 26 lb plate carrier under hoodie, power walking ~3.4 mph
- Barely increased breathing — load too light for his size (232 lbs, ~11% BW)
- Did two 100m shuffles for variety
- Needs 35-40+ lbs next time or hills to reach Zone 2

### Zone 2 Indicators (No Watch)
Cody didn't have his smartwatch. Body-based Zone 2 markers:
- **Talk test** — full sentences without gasping, couldn't sing
- **Nose breathing** — mouth opens = above Zone 2
- **RPE 4-5/10** — "could do this for an hour"
- **Breathing rhythm** — steady, not ragged
- **Light sweat, not drenched**

### Correction: Military Ruck Pace
I said 4.0 mph was standard. Cody corrected: **3.2 mph is standard.** He's right — 3.2-3.4 is actual ruck march pace. 4.0 is the fast end (Army 12-mile qualifier). Don't overcall military knowledge to a Marine.

### Morning Sequence Established
**Training days (W/F/Sa):**
1. Wake
2. Bright light (outside or curtains)
3. Coffee + MCT oil + creatine
4. Pills (D3, choline, Stress B) — D3 needs fat, MCT covers it
5. ~15 min for coffee
6. Warmup protocol (8 min)
7. Workout

**Non-training days:**
Same through pills, then 10 min standalone mobility instead of workout.

## Evening Session — Medication & Training Docs Sent (prev session, 21:43-23:06)

Carried from 2026-02-11 evening. Cody asked for training docs sent to phone (no PC access). Sent both medication architecture and full training program via Signal.

### Topics Covered
- Conditioning deep dive: aerobic > resistance for pure brain benefit, but combination beats both
- Rucking identified as optimal modality for him (weight-bearing + low impact)
- Ruck weight: start 26 lbs, build to 45 lbs (benchmark target)
- Jump rope: EliteSRS Fit+ or any 10ft+ adjustable. Rogue SR-1S not on Amazon
- First night sleep protocol started — expected rough, REM rebound likely in nights 2-4
- Qelbree starting Friday, Adderall stopping Friday (psych confirmed)

### Corrections
- **Don't tell Cody to sleep.** Said it twice, caught twice. He's managing a baby and his own schedule.

## Open Threads
- [ ] Training starts Wednesday (Full Body A, first session)
- [ ] Need more ruck weight — stuff backpack or get heavier plates
- [ ] Qelbree starts Friday / Adderall stops Friday
- [ ] Labcorp Vitamin D test — schedule
- [ ] Order: fractional plates, jump rope
- [ ] Office redesign — Saturday
- [ ] Library physical reorganization — Saturday
- [ ] Infra: gcal OAuth, NAS SSH, broken scripts

---

## Medication & Training Docs Sent (evening prior, carried over)

Sent full medication architecture and training program to Cody's phone via Signal. He was without PC. Both documents delivered as formatted text messages.

## Conditioning Deep Dive (21:47-23:06 CST prior evening)

- Aerobic > resistance for pure brain benefit (BDNF, hippocampal neurogenesis)
- But combination beats both — different pathways that compound
- Resistance has edge for executive function (ADHD target)
- Rucking = optimal modality for Cody: weight-bearing + low joint impact at 232 lbs
- Jump rope: EliteSRS Fit+ or any 10ft+ adjustable. At 195cm needs ~9.5 ft rope.

## Morning Ruck & Protocol Start (06:21-06:48 CST)

### First Ruck
- Out at 6:21am — day 1, snap change working
- 26 lb plate carrier under hoodie, ~3.4 mph, 35 minutes
- Zone 2 NOT reached — barely increased breathing
- Aerobic base higher than estimated (half marathon Nov 2022 + military)
- Shuffle/jogged 10 mins with minimal response
- **Correction:** Military ruck pace is 3.2 mph standard, not 4.0. I overcalled it. Cody corrected.
- Need 35-40+ lbs next time or hills

### Zone 2 Without Watch
Cody didn't have smartwatch. Body indicators: talk test (full sentences), nose breathing (mouth opens = above Z2), RPE 4-5/10, rhythmic breathing, light sweat.

### Morning Sequence Established
Training days: Wake → bright light → coffee+MCT+creatine → pills (D3/choline/Stress B) → 15 min → warmup → workout.
Non-training days: Same through pills, then 10 min mobility.

### Adderall Timing
Take after workout, not before. Stimulants elevate HR and vasoconstrict — skews Zone 2 data and adds cardiovascular strain.

### Projections to June 5 (16 weeks)
- Squat 135→265-280, Bench 135→240-255, DL 185→315-335
- Body comp: ~232→215-220 lbs, ~20-22%→15-17% BF
- Aerobic: sub-25 5K, 10K comfortable, 12mi ruck in reach
- Cognitive: BDNF improvements by mid-April, compounding through June
- Medication: 3+ months Qelbree data by June

### Training Log Created

## Library Full QA (07:17-11:30 CST)

### Trigger
Cody asked to look at zones with fewest books. Saw Education (18) was incoherent. Asked for full book-by-book QA — "I mean you do it" (not a sub-agent).

### Pass 1: Education Dissolved + Major Fixes (07:20)
- Education zone eliminated — 18 books redistributed to Philosophy, Manuals, Word, Life
- 10 duplicate entries removed across all zones
- 15 corrupt series fields fixed (data bleeding from adjacent rows)
- 8 author names corrected
- 9 zone reclassifications
- 603 → 593 books, 12 zones

### Pass 2: Manuals Split (10:48)
- Cody asked if there's a distinction between reference and instructional books — yes
- Split Manuals → Craft (53) + Reference (15)
- Back to 13 zones

### Pass 3-7: Zone-by-Zone Audit (10:53-11:30)
Went through 10 of 13 zones book by book:

**Psychology (40):** 5 reclassifications — Sapiens/Hedges/Scott→History, Graeber/Sennett→Philosophy. Manning author fixed.

**History (36) + Life (55):** 5 reclassifications — Hagakure/Art of War→Philosophy, Armed Forces Officer→Reference, Akkad→Literary Fiction, Didion→Literary Fiction, Graham→History. Author fixes: Thucydides, Mayo Clinic.

**Philosophy (74) + Word (41):** Camus Stranger→Literary Fiction, Pinker Blank Slate→Psychology. Author fixes: Piemonte, Poe, Xenophon. Series/title data cleaned.

**Science & Systems (42) + Literary Fiction (75):** 9 S&S moves — technical textbooks→Reference, hands-on→Craft, finance→Business. Wiener author fixed. Literary Fiction clean — zero zone changes needed.

**Fantasy (55) + Business (33):** No zone changes. Series data fixes: Babel freed from wrong series, Fire & Blood set as companion, First Law standardized, Malice series added. Collins formatting fixed. Prachi book flagged for verification.

### Remaining: Genre Fiction, Science Fiction, Craft — 3 zones unaudited

### Current State
593 books, 13 zones:
- Philosophy 74, Literary Fiction 75, Life 55, Fantasy 55, Craft 55
- Science & Systems 42, Psychology 41, Word 41, Science Fiction 41
- History 36, Business 33, Genre Fiction 23, Reference 22

## Dashy Dashboard Fix (09:22 CST)

Cody reported Dashy links broken. I had previously changed all service URLs from LAN IPs to Tailscale IPs. Reverted:
- 100.87.6.45 → 192.168.0.29 (worker-node services)
- 100.104.41.59 → 192.168.0.120 (NAS)
Dashy restarted, working.

## Syncthing Discovery (08:33-08:36 CST)

Cody asked where the CSV was — couldn't find it on Metis. I initially said theke sync wasn't set up — **wrong.** Syncthing `aletheia-vault` folder exists, bidirectional, path `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/theke`. The CSV was there but hadn't synced yet (Syncthing lag). Sub-agent had already SCP'd it to Metis directly. File confirmed on Metis at `/home/ck/aletheia/theke/_reference/library/physical_organized.csv`.

**Lesson:** Check existing infrastructure before claiming something doesn't exist.

---

## Corrections
1. **Military ruck pace:** 3.2 mph standard, not 4.0. Don't overcall military knowledge to a Marine.
2. **Dashy IPs:** I broke it by changing LAN→Tailscale. Reverted.
3. **Theke sync exists:** Syncthing aletheia-vault folder is live. I said it wasn't set up — wrong.
4. **"Do it yourself":** When Cody says he wants me to do something, don't delegate to sub-agent.
5. **Stop telling him to sleep:** Repeated correction.

### Curation Pass
Identified ~20 books as potential "don't belong" — MBA textbooks, corporate self-help, surface picks, YA leftovers. Cody removed 3:
- Calkins, Breakthrough Marketing Plans (MBA)
- Kotler, Marketing Management 16th (MBA)
- Cornwell, Archer's Tale (friend's book, not his)

### Lonesome Dove Decision
Cody asked my opinion. I argued Literary Fiction — "same quiet devastation as Stoner, more in common with Williams than Cornwell." He agreed. Moved.

### Final State
589 books, 13 zones. ~50 total fixes across audit. All committed and pushed.

## Lidarr / Prowlarr / Indexer Expansion (12:12-13:32 CST)

### Colter Wall Investigation
Cody asked why Lidarr couldn't find Colter Wall tracks. Investigation:
- All 5 full albums at 100% — already had everything
- Missing items were all **singles** (Bob Fudge, Happy Reunion, Kate McCannon, etc.)
- Quality profile was fine (both FLAC and FLAC 24bit enabled) — **I initially misread API output and blamed quality filtering. Screenshot from Cody proved me wrong.**
- Real issue: public torrent indexers don't carry singles from indie artists

### Prowlarr Expansion: 25 → 40 Indexers
Systematically tried every public/semi-private indexer Prowlarr supports:

**Successfully added (15):** BT.etree (music-focused), NorTorrent, Uindex, ZkTorrent, Zamunda RIP, BigFANGroup, RuTor, TorrentProject2, MagnetDownload, ilCorSaRoNeRo, Catorrent, OpenSharing, showRSS, FileMood, Elitetorrent-wf.

**Failed — VPN IP blocked:** RuTracker.RU, kickasstorrents.to, ExtraTorrent.st, TorrentCore, GTorrent.club

All 40 indexers tagged with `flare` tag for Byparr proxy.

### Byparr Deployment
- FlareSolverr was configured in Prowlarr but **no container was running** — port 8191 mapped on gluetun but empty
- Byparr is the current FlareSolverr replacement (drop-in, same API)
- Deployed: `ghcr.io/thephaseless/byparr:latest` on gluetun's network
- Running and healthy on `localhost:8191`
- Cloudflare-protected sites still fail due to VPN exit IP blocking, not Byparr issue

### Bob Fudge / Happy Reunion
- 7" single: "Happy Reunion / Bob Fudge" by Colter Wall & The Scary Prairie Boys (La Honda Records, 2019)
- **Pulled from Spotify** (shows up but "currently unavailable")
- Available on **Qobuz** for FLAC purchase
- Physical 7" available on Discogs and 10,000 Hz Records

### Qobuz Zips
Cody asked me to review Qobuz zips in downloads and move missing music to NAS. No zips found on worker-node or NAS. Asked Cody where they are — session ended before answer. Metis is offline.

## Afternoon Session (13:30-16:30 CST)

### Qobuz Music Import
Processed 5 zip files from Metis (`/home/ck/Downloads/`) containing Qobuz FLAC purchases:
- **Colter Wall — Happy Reunion/Bob Fudge (2019)**: 2 tracks. Lidarr album #4110, now 2/2.
- **Ian Noe — Off This Mountaintop (2017)**: 4 tracks (EP). Lidarr album #12213, now 4/4.
- **Ian Noe — River Fools & Mountain Saints (2022)**: 3 of 12 tracks (Pine Grove, River Fool, Burning Down the Prairie — these are singles from the full album). Lidarr album #12215, 3/12.

**Lidarr lesson:** `RescanArtist` does NOT auto-import files placed directly on the NAS. Must use the `ManualImport` API with explicit artistId/albumId/albumReleaseId/trackIds. Album match threshold is 80% — folder naming mismatches (slash vs underscore) can reject otherwise-correct matches.

### Metis SSH Fix
Cody corrected me — Metis was NOT offline, just on wifi. IP addresses:
- Ethernet: 192.168.0.19
- WiFi: 192.168.0.20
- Must check which network when connecting.

### Syncthing Stale File
Library CSV on Metis was 594 lines (old) vs worker-node 590 (current). Syncthing API showed `NeedFiles: 0` and `InSyncFiles` matched `GlobalFiles` — claimed in-sync but wasn't. Likely root-owned file on Metis that Syncthing couldn't overwrite. Fixed via direct `scp`.

### HOA Violation Analysis (MAJOR)
Cody received 2 violations from **Entrada Residential Community** (managed by **PMP Management**, Round Rock) about his 1997 Ram 2500 in the driveway. He's been pushing hard on the truck build specifically to address this.

**Violation #1** (Jan 29, 2026): "Friendly Reminder" — remove non-operational vehicle from common area view. 10 days to cure. Cites CC&R Article 2, Section 2.22, page 14.

**Violation #2** (Feb 11, 2026): Formal Notice of Violation — Curable. $25 fine assessed. 30 days to cure (by March 13). Sent certified mail.

**CRITICAL FINDING — Wrong section cited:**
- Section 2.22 is titled **"Mobile Homes, Travel Trailers and Recreational Vehicles"** — applies ONLY to those three vehicle types. A pickup truck is none of those.
- The 72-hour temp parking rule in 2.22 also only applies to mobile homes/RVs.

**Section 2.21 (Unsightly Articles) — the actually relevant section — EXEMPTS pickups:**
> "...trailers, graders, **trucks other than pickups**, boats, tractors, wagons, buses, motorcycles..."

Pickups are explicitly carved out of the list of vehicles that must be enclosed or screened from view.

**No "non-operational vehicle" provision exists anywhere in the CC&Rs.**

**Texas Property Code Chapter 209 protections:**
- §209.006: Notice requirements, curable violation (parking = statutory example of curable)
- §209.006(e): If owner cures before expiration, fine may NOT be assessed
- §209.007: Right to request hearing within 30 days, HOA must provide evidence packet 10 days before hearing, owner can audio record
- Selective enforcement is challengeable under Chapter 209

**CC&R Details:**
- Filed: 2018187175, Travis County, Dec 4, 2018
- Declarant: Lennar Homes of Texas Land and Construction, Ltd.
- HOA: Entrada Residential Community, Inc.
- Management: PMP Management, 551 S IH35 Suite 150, Round Rock TX 78664
- Full CC&Rs: scanned PDF (70 pages, Canon copier, no text layer — needed OCR via image analysis)

**Context:** Cody is frustrated/angry. The truck represents self-reliance, anti-planned-obsolescence, building something that endures. HOA threatening that project hits his core values. He wants legally specific partner-level analysis, not general advice.

### Open Threads
- [ ] **Draft formal response letter to PMP Management** — Cody asked, not yet written
- [ ] Verify no other CC&R articles could apply (Article 2 checked thoroughly — clean)
- [ ] Consider requesting board hearing as tactical move (buys time, forces evidence disclosure)
- [ ] Save CC&Rs and violation docs to theke for permanent reference

### Letter Drafted and Sent
Cody reviewed, edited, and sent the response letter via email to PMP Management (Eric Mayfield). Final version is a PDF he created from the docx. Five arguments:
1. Section 2.22 (cited) only covers mobile homes/RVs, not pickup trucks
2. Section 2.21 explicitly exempts pickups from restricted vehicle list
3. "Non-operational" doesn't appear anywhere in the Declaration
4. Citing wrong section fails §209.006(b)(1) notice requirements
5. PMP was informed truck was operable (Kendall's calls Feb 2 + Feb 5), never returned calls, fined anyway

Added after requests: burden of proof paragraph citing Pilarcik v. Emmons (Tex. 1998) on strict construction of restrictive covenants. Hearing reservation under §209.007.

Cody also asked for email requesting his email be CC'd on future correspondence.

### Escalation Analysis
Walked through full escalation scenarios at Cody's request:
- Most likely: PMP backs down (not worth fighting over $25 with a well-documented homeowner)
- Retaliatory nitpicking: selective enforcement, challengeable under Chapter 209
- Re-issue under correct section: resets timeline, 2.21 still exempts pickups
- Worst case: accumulated fines, attorney demand letter, potential lien. Extremely unlikely over this.
- §209.008(b): owner not liable for HOA attorney fees incurred before hearing concludes
- Pro se can't recover own time in Texas

Cody decided he won't pay the $25 fine regardless.

### Context
- Declarant control: Lennar still runs the HOA board (neighborhood not fully built out)
- PMP hires drive-by violation photographer
- Cody frustrated at pseudo-legal intimidation from faceless management company
- Military comparison: none of this existed in USMC housing
- Regrets buying into HOA neighborhood

### Evidence Archived

- `theke/oikia/hoa/response_letter_2026-02-12.md`: final draft (markdown)
- Docx copy delivered to Metis ~/Downloads/
