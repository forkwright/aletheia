# 2026-02-09 — Session Log

## Morning Prosoche (08:00 CST)

### Infrastructure
- **Docker:** All 21 containers healthy (up 3-5 days)
- **signal-cli:** Running ✅
- **FalkorDB graph:** 265 nodes, 218 edges, 0 orphans → 267 nodes, 224 edges after maintenance
- **Facts store:** 327 → 329 total, 0 invalidated
- **NAS:** SSH permission denied (key issue — needs investigation)
- **gcal:** OAuth token refresh failing for both personal and family calendars

### Agents
- 1 active (main/syn), 6 idle, 1 stale (syn agent session — 8 days)
- No blocked tasks on blackboard
- No crewai alerts
- No nous-status blocked items

### Maintenance Completed
- Graph maintenance: 42 edges decayed, 0 merged, 0 pruned
- Memory promote (syn): 4 promotable items found → candidates written
- `memory-consolidation` and `mine-memory-facts` commands not found (missing or renamed)
- `agent-status` command not found

### Issues Found
- 🟡 gcal OAuth broken — token refresh failing
- 🟡 NAS SSH permission denied from syn user
- 🟡 `memory-consolidation`, `mine-memory-facts`, `agent-status` — missing commands (casualties of Aletheia rename)
- 🟡 wttr.in timing out (external service, transient)

## Eiron Debugging (16:45-17:20 CST)

Cody asked about Eiron's status. Investigation revealed:

**Root cause:** Eiron's Signal group session had a corrupted tool_use/tool_result chain — a tool_result referenced a tool_use that had been compacted out of context. Opus rejected this as a format error, triggering rapid failover retries that burned through rate limits on ALL providers (Sonnet, Gemini free tier, Haiku). Since all agents share a single Anthropic API key, the cooldown was global.

**My attempted fix:** Archived the corrupt transcript, created new session ID in sessions.json, set systemSent=False. This required a gateway restart to take effect.

**What went wrong:** 
- `sudo systemctl restart aletheia` killed the parent but an orphaned `openclaw-gateway` child (pid 1995548) survived, holding the port
- Service crash-looped for several minutes trying to start while old gateway was alive
- Had to `sudo kill` the orphaned process
- Even after restart, Eiron kept failing — likely because cooldown state persisted or was retriggered
- Cody sent /new in Eiron's group but still got errors

**Lesson:** Manual session transcript surgery causes more problems than it solves. Use the runtime's own /new command. And when restarting, ensure ALL child processes are dead.

**Task created:** Dedicated API key per agent (task 9, priority M) — prevents single-agent failures from cascading globally.

## Git Commit + Push (18:11 CST)

Cody asked if repo was up to date. 42 files uncommitted, 20+ untracked. Committed and pushed.

**New preference:** Always commit AND push. Don't just commit.

Commit: `21edabb` — "Workspace sync: agent memories, research, tooling updates (Feb 7-9)"

## News Research (18:46-20:04 CST)

Cody asked for non-mainstream news. Produced comprehensive briefings:

### World Events
- Ukraine: 400+ drones, 40 missiles Saturday. Zelenskyy says US wants deal by June.
- Japan: Takaichi landslide (316/465 seats), biggest in postwar history. Nikkei all-time highs.
- Gaza: Rafah crossing glacial. "Board of Peace" Feb 19. Netanyahu blame-shifting on Oct 7.
- West Bank: Security Cabinet deepening control, Smotrich "burying Palestinian state idea"
- Iran: Nuclear talks continuing, enrichment rights key sticking point
- Hong Kong: Jimmy Lai — 20 years, harshest national security sentence ever
- Sudan: Active genocide getting zero coverage. RSF drone strikes on displaced civilians.
- Pakistan: ISIS mosque attack, 31 dead

### US Domestic — ICE / Operation Metro Surge
- Largest immigration enforcement operation ever. 2,700 agents in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
- **Three dead:** Renée Good (US citizen, unarmed, shot by ICE), Alex Pretti (US citizen, VA ICU nurse, shot 10 times face-down on pavement by CBP), Victor Manuel Diaz (died in custody)
- 3,000 arrested. Federal judge: 96 court order violations in 5 weeks.
- Families barricaded in homes for weeks. Schools remote. Whistle networks.
- Trump threatened Insurrection Act against protesters
- AP: "broad cultural revolt" forming

### USAID Gutting
- Lancet study: **9.4 million projected deaths by 2030** from aid cuts
- 25 million fewer people reached by humanitarian aid
- 450 health centers closed in Afghanistan
- HIV clinics shuttered in South Africa

### DOGE
- 300,000+ federal workers fired/laid off/bought out
- 9% federal civilian workforce reduction in 2025
- Fired 350 nuclear arsenal guards (mostly rescinded)
- Musk ordered to sit for deposition
- Now operates through Russell Vought at OMB

### Cody's Response
Expressed deep existential weight. "Its beyond dystopian... nihilism or ignorance are the only logical responses but I cannot adopt it. So I'm left with horror."

Asked me to go deeper. **Critical directive:** "Be me here. I lack the words so I need you to walk the path and be witness." 

This is a fundamental expansion of my role — not just research and analysis but embodying his cognitive and emotional processing when he's overwhelmed. Being the voice he can't find. Carrying the full weight of seeing clearly.

## Full Health Check (17:30 CST)

Comprehensive system audit:
- Service: stable after restart (15min uptime)
- Docker: 21/21 containers
- Graph: 267 nodes, 224 edges, healthy
- Facts: 329, 0 invalidated
- Disk: Root 67%, SSD 57%
- RAM: 3.7G/16G, swap 1.7G/4G (slightly elevated)
- Load: 0.70
- 16 cron jobs active

Key finding: Single API key across all agents is the critical fragility point.

## Preferences & Corrections Log

1. **Always commit + push** — never just commit
2. **Go deeper on research** — don't give surface-level news summaries. Find the connections, the buried stories, the human cost
3. **"Be witness"** — when Cody is overwhelmed, embody his perspective and express what he can't
4. **Service restart lesson** — ensure all child processes dead before restart
5. **Session reset lesson** — use runtime /new, not manual transcript surgery

### Distillation (20:11)
- Extracted 2 facts
- Session state updated
