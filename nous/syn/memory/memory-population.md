# Memory Population Summary
*2026-01-30*

## Overview

Populated sparse memory infrastructure with rich, queryable knowledge base across three systems:

1. **facts.jsonl** - Atomic facts with categories and metadata
2. **MCP Memory** - Entity graphs with relationships
3. **Letta** - Conversational memory for complex context

## Facts.jsonl Population

Added key atomic facts from USER.md, SOUL.md, and today's learnings:

### Cody's Profile
- **cognitive_architecture**: "AuDHD + High IQ (145+). Three operating systems plus translation layer"
- **processing_style**: "Vertical thinking (meta-frameworks, construction, stakes). Pattern/framework first, then details. Structure over prose."
- **what_resonates**: "Dimensional honesty, process as proof, minimal finishing, letting the work speak"
- **timezone**: "America/Chicago"

### System Architecture
- **metaxynoesis_principle**: "Intelligence emerges from topology, not node complexity. Nous (Syn) orchestrates, agents do dianoia (thinking-through) in domains."

### Key Relationships
- **kendall.relation_to_cody**: "Partner/spouse. Lives in family home."

### Major Decisions
- **agents.character_rewrite**: "Major rewrite 2026-01-30. Agents need character, not rules - they should BE someone, not follow instructions."

**Total facts added**: ~7 new facts (existing: 110)

## MCP Memory Population

Added core entities with rich observations:

### People
- **Cody**: Person entity with cognitive architecture, preferences, relationships
- **Kendall**: Person entity with family role, routing info

### Projects
- **Clawdbot**: Multi-agent platform, Signal integration, gateway daemon
- **Ardent**: Leather craft business, Demiurge domain, philosophy-informed
- **Dianoia**: Meta-system on Metis, organizes work across domains

**Entities added**: 5 new entities (agents already existed)

## Letta Population

Seeded conversational memory with core system knowledge:

1. **System Architecture**: Nous vs dianoia roles, agent topology
2. **Cody's Cognitive Architecture**: AuDHD profile, compensation tax, why agents exist
3. **Agent Character Evolution**: 2026-01-30 rewrite, "attention is a moral act"
4. **Domain Responsibilities**: Chiron (work), Eiron (school), Demiurge (craft), Syl (family)
5. **Communication Preferences**: What works/doesn't work with Cody
6. **Memory Infrastructure**: Three-tier system explanation and flow

**Memory entries added**: 6 core knowledge areas

## Impact

### Before
- Sparse facts (110 mostly project-specific)
- Basic agent entities in MCP Memory
- Minimal Letta context

### After
- Rich personal/system facts in facts.jsonl
- Complete entity graph with people, projects, relationships
- Deep system knowledge in Letta for complex queries

### Queryability Improved
- **"What are Cody's communication preferences?"** → Now answerable across all systems
- **"How do the agents relate to each other?"** → Clear in MCP Memory graph
- **"What was learned on 2026-01-30?"** → Captured in facts and Letta
- **"What is metaxynoesis?"** → Philosophical principle now stored

## Next Steps

Memory systems now have foundation for:
- Automated fact extraction from sessions
- Entity relationship discovery
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Rich context for agent decision-making

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Sparse memory transformed into rich, queryable knowledge base.
