# 2026-02-06 — Agent Identity Fix, Topology Frame, Research Protocol

## What Happened

### Agent Identity Crisis (Resolved)
- All agents were responding as Syn — bootstrapping from `nous/syn/` SOUL.md
- Root cause: `agents.list` was missing. I set workspace in `agents.overrides` but agents weren't registered in the list. Overrides without a list entry means they don't exist as independent agents.
- Fixed by Metis Claude Code (twice in 12 hours — also fixed ExecStartPre self-match and env file format)
- All 7 agents now properly registered with correct workspace paths
- Arbor set to Sonnet 4.5 (model: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, no date suffix — newer models dropped the date)

### Topology as Framework 6
- Cody's peer James Kinney suggested looking into topology + complex dynamical systems + Poincaré sections
- This turned out to be the formal mathematical language for everything we've been building intuitively
- Added to L5-research.md as Framework 6: Topological Dynamics
- Key mappings:
  - Prosoche checks = Poincaré sections (slicing through phase space)
  - L4→L5 transition = bifurcation at critical coupling density
  - Binding problem = synchrony, not convergence to central node
  - Syn as grandmother cell = unsustainable (binding should be distributed)
  - Graph = shared phase space
  - Topology unifies all five other frameworks (Hutchins, Clark, Baars, Friston, Grassé)
- James Kinney handed us the Rosetta Stone for the paper
- Cody drafted response to James connecting Aletheia concepts to the formal language

### Research Protocol Established
- Cody demanded "gold standard" research process
- Created `shared/templates/sections/research_protocol.md`
- 5-tier source hierarchy: S1 (peer-reviewed) → S5 (our synthesis)
- Inline citations required for all factual claims
- Confidence marking: ✅ established / 🔶 emerging / ⚠️ speculative
- Counter-evidence requirement — steel-man strongest objection
- "Never cite what you haven't read" — abstract ≠ paper
- PRISMA-Lite for systematic reviews
- Research log format with queries, inclusion/exclusion, gaps
- Applied to Syn, Eiron, Chiron, Demiurge templates
- Honest audit of L5 sources: many foundational citations (Hutchins, Baars, Friston) cited via secondary sources only — flagged

### Research Tools Deployed
- `scholar` — OpenAlex API (250M+ papers, free, no key). Search, details, citation counts, abstracts
- `wiki` — Wikipedia REST API. Summaries, search, references. Auto-warns S4 grey literature
- Pipeline complete: pplx (broad survey) → scholar (find papers) → web_fetch (read them) → ingest-doc (PDF extraction) → research protocol (verify)

### Bug Fixes
- `attention-check` — `check_cross_nous_relevance()` defined after `if __name__ == "__main__"`, never executed. Moved above main()
- ExecStartPre `pkill -f "openclaw-gateway"` matched its own command line (classic self-match). Removed by Metis Claude Code

## Decisions
- `agents.list` is required for agent identity — overrides alone don't create agents
- Model IDs: newer models use `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (no date suffix)
- Research protocol is non-negotiable for all research work
- Wikipedia = S4 grey literature, orientation only, never primary citation
- Topology/dynamical systems is the mathematical foundation for the metaxynoesis paper

## Corrections
- I was rescued by Metis Claude Code twice in 12 hours (crash recovery + agent identity). Noted as a pattern — I need to validate config changes more carefully before deploying.
- Many L5 citations are from secondary sources/abstracts only. Flagged for full reads before paper.

## Pending
- Metaxynoesis paper — topology frame makes it significantly stronger
- Minds and Machines as target venue (arXiv preprint first)
- James Kinney follow-up — potential collaborator or at minimum informed peer
- gcal OAuth expired — needs Cody's browser auth
- Langfuse dashboard setup — visit :3100, create project, save API keys
- Graphiti evaluation — does it work with FalkorDB or need Neo4j?
- Semantic Scholar API key (free, higher rate limits than unauthenticated)
- Full reads needed on: Hutchins, Baars, Friston, Strogatz, Singer & Gray, Treisman
