# 2026-02-06 — TBC Capstone Data Validation

## Session Summary
Cody asked me to validate what data is still needed from TBC for the member segmentation workstream (Phase 1). This is the capstone project for UT McCombs TEMBA SP26.

## Key Findings

### Public Data Scraped (Feb 6)
Full member roster scraped from texasblockchaincouncil.org/membership via browser:
- **10 Executive Partners**: Core Scientific, Cipher Mining, Bitdeer, RARE Network, Priority Power, Polkadot, CUTX, Iris Energy, Riot Platforms, MARA
- **19 Strategic Partners**: Kraken, Fortris, Giga Energy, Mothership Energy, Weaver, Cholla Inc, Krown Network, Blockchain.com, Chainlink Labs, BankSocial, Cormint, Ionic Digital, Hut 8, Galaxy, Third Coast Bank, CleanSpark, The Network Firm, Coinbase, Gray Reed
- **~65 Standard Partners**: Including Luxor, NYDIG, Block, Crypto.com, Compass Mining, Deloitte, Grayscale, Foundry, Unchained, Fidelity, Ledger, Consensys, etc.
- **~20 Startup/Nonprofit Members**: Including Barrio Energy, Zelus, Quantum Expeditions, Mainstay Digital, etc.
- **Individual members**: Not shown on public site (70 total per Stephen)

### Membership Waterfall PDF Extracted
Downloaded and OCR'd `TBC_MembershipWaterfall_Final_2025.pdf` — shows benefit tiers:
- Standard (2 reps), Strategic (4 reps), Executive (6 reps)
- Key differentiators: marketing webinars (Strategic+), board eligibility (Strategic+), VIP events with officials (Executive), premier logo spot (Executive)
- **No pricing on the PDF** — pricing came from discovery call

### 990 Financial Data (ProPublica)
- 2024: $2.25M revenue, $1.79M expenses, $603K assets, $389K liabilities
- Lee Bratcher comp: $391K (2024), $300K (2023), $327K (2022)
- 11 board members as of Dec 2024
- 501(c)(6) — business league designation

### What We Already Had (From 2 Client Calls)
- **Kickoff (Jan 8)**: Problem statement, team structure, academic requirements, industry context
- **Discovery Call (Jan 20)**: Full transcript exists at `/mnt/ssd/aletheia/projects/mba/sp26/capstone/meetings/2026-01-20_discovery_call_transcript.md`
  - Tier pricing: Executive $50K, Strategic $25K, Startup ~3% of revenue
  - 175 members (110 companies, 70 individuals), 87% retention
  - Stephen's qualitative tier assessment
  - Bespoke "Rolodex access" demand
  - Giovanni's "broader tent" vision
  - Public member list ≈ complete list (hidden members < handful)
  - No survey data exists
  - PUC FOIA filed for large flexible load operators (75+ MW)
  - Competitor lists from Stephen (filed at capstone root as .docx files)

### Phase 1 Segmentation Assessment
**NOT BLOCKED.** Can be done with:
- Public member list (scraped, with tier assignments)
- Sector classification from company URLs
- Tier economics from discovery call
- Tension mapping from qualitative call data

**Gaps that are Phase 2 / other workstreams (NOT needed for Phase 1 segmentation):**
- PUC FOIA response (TAM sizing — WS2/ERCOT)
- Engagement metrics (Phase 2 validation)
- Revenue breakdown by tier (financial analysis)
- Member join dates/tenure (retention analysis)
- Interview introductions (Phase 2)

### Cody's Correction
I initially overclaimed what was missing — didn't check our own call materials before listing gaps. The discovery call transcript and summary had most of the qualitative data already. Lesson: verify what we have before stating what we need.
