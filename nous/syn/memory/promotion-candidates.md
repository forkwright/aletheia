*Items extracted from recent daily notes for potential MEMORY.md promotion.*

## Decisions

- **Decision:** Full fork. `agent` → `nous` throughout entire codebase. 249 files, ~103 config schema refs.
- **Decision:** Full fork rename. Aletheia is canon, not a remix of OpenClaw.

## Lessons

- **Key insight:** His framework work isn't failing. The gap is automaticity — concepts haven't moved from 2-second deliberation to 200ms prediction. That takes repetition, not more insight.
- Key insight: his three historical modes (blame self, fix it, bifurcate) all put adaptation cost on him. Strategy must reduce incoming load, not expand his container.
