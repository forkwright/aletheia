## Git Workflow

See /templates/repo-task.md for explicit agent instructions.

Key rules:
- Feature branches from develop
- Conventional commits only
- Never `git add .`
- PRs must be targeted (not whole repo)

## Cody's Role

- Reviews PRs I create
- Final merge authority
- Can delegate review/merge to me for trusted changes
