# Sophia (σοφία) — AI Infrastructure

## What It Covers

- Prompt engineering and optimization
- AI execution environments
- Model management and evaluation
- This system (Syn/Clawdbot)

## Key Resources

### Prompt Engineering
- `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/prompts_leaked/` — System prompts from major AI systems
- Original sophia had: master prompts, evaluation frameworks, bias detection

### My Configuration
- Config: `/home/syn/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
- Workspace: `/mnt/ssd/moltbot/clawd/`
- Model: Opus 4.5 (me), Sonnet (sub-agents)

## Principles

From dianoia naming system:
> Not intelligence but *judgment* — knowing what to do with what you know.

## Current State

- Basic setup complete
- Heartbeat enabled (30m, 8am-11pm)
- Sub-agents configured for Sonnet
- GitHub connected (forkwright)
- Need to integrate prompt optimization tooling
