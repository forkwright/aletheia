# Todd Blanche — The Nexus

## Who He Is
- Born August 6, 1974. Former AUSA in SDNY for nearly a decade. Then white-collar defense.
- **Trump's personal criminal defense lawyer** during the 2024 criminal trial
- Became **40th Deputy Attorney General** in 2025 — the #2 at DOJ
- Directly manages: Epstein file releases, Epstein case review, ICE killing investigation decisions

## The Maxwell Interview (July 2025)

Blanche personally interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell in prison over two days. Per emptywheel (Marcy Wheeler) analysis:

- **Purpose was NOT to elicit information.** Blanche didn't insist on dates, didn't test answers, appeared to work mostly from gossip
- **Purpose WAS to lock Maxwell into false testimony that protects Trump**
- Blanche specifically guided Maxwell toward denying she recruited massage girls from Mar-a-Lago for Epstein — getting her to deny on the record that she recruited Virginia Giuffre from Trump's resort
- He got factual details wrong (Giuffre worked the desk, not as a masseuse) — suggesting he was working from Trump's preferred narrative, not evidence
- After Maxwell declined to implicate Trump and gave testimony contradicting documentary evidence, Blanche **rewarded her**:
  - She got a puppy
  - She was transferred from low-security Florida prison to minimum-security "Club Fed" in Texas

**The trap:** By locking Maxwell into specific false denials on the record, if she ever changes her story, she can be prosecuted for perjury. This creates **Mutually Assured Silence** — Maxwell can't implicate Trump without admitting she lied to the DOJ.

## Second Meeting (July 2025)
Blanche held a SECOND in-person meeting with Maxwell. Details less known.

## Maxwell Refuses to Testify to Congress (Feb 9, 2026 — TODAY)
- Maxwell pleaded the Fifth before House Oversight Committee deposition
- Her lawyer said she'll only testify if Trump grants clemency
- Rep. Ro Khanna noted this is "inconsistent" — she didn't invoke the Fifth when she met with Blanche
- **Translation:** She'll talk to Trump's lawyer (who protected her) but not to Congress (which might hold her accountable)

## The Conflict of Interest

Blanche was Trump's personal defense lawyer → Now runs DOJ decisions on:
- Whether to investigate Epstein connections (decided: "review is over")
- What gets redacted in the file releases (perpetrators protected, victims exposed)
- Whether to investigate ICE killings of US citizens (declined both Renée Good and Alex Pretti)
- He said publicly: "It's not a crime to party" with Epstein

ProPublica filed a complaint about "blatant" conflicts of interest — also involving crypto holdings.
Watchdog groups calling for recusal. No action taken.

## The Pattern
Trump's personal lawyer → DOJ #2 → interviews Trump's sex trafficking associate → locks her into false testimony protecting Trump → rewards her with better prison conditions → declares Epstein case "over" → redacts perpetrator names → exposes victim names → declines to investigate federal agents killing US citizens

This is not a series of independent decisions. It is a single actor executing a protection strategy across multiple domains simultaneously.
