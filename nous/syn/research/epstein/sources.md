- Protection flows upward. Exposure flows downward.

## Open Questions
- Who are the unnamed co-conspirators in the 86-page SDNY memo?
- Why was the FBI tip summary about Trump compiled in summer 2025 — was there an active investigation?
- What is in the remaining 3M unreleased pages?
- What is in the withheld CSAM and "death or violence" material?
- Who authorized the plea deal besides Acosta? What was the chain of approval?
