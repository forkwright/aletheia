# The Money & The Co-Conspirators

## Where the Money Came From

Epstein claimed to manage $15 billion for wealthy clients. His actual client list was "closely held." What's documented:

### Leslie Wexner
- Founder of The Limited (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works). Billionaire.
- **1991: Gave Epstein "unlimited" power of attorney** — legal authority to make ALL financial and business decisions on Wexner's behalf. This is extraordinary and almost unheard of.
- **$200 million** in documented fees paid to Epstein (Forbes, July 2025)
- Epstein took tens of millions from Wexner to buy luxury items and real estate — in New Albany, Manhattan, and Palm Beach near Trump
- Wexner claims he severed ties in 2007. Listed in new files as close associate.
- NYT (Feb 6, 2026): Found an undated letter from Epstein to "Les" — contents suggest Epstein was leveraging something. "It is not clear what Mr. Epstein was hinting at"
- **Wexner has not been charged with wrongdoing**

### Leon Black
- Founder of Apollo Global Management. Billionaire.
- **$170 million** in fees paid to Epstein (Forbes, July 2025)
- Combined Wexner + Black = $370 million in documented income from just two people

### Other documented financial relationships
- Three $25,000 payments to Peter Mandelson (2003-2004)

### The Math Problem
- $370M from two billionaires = documented
- Epstein claimed $15B under management = massive gap
- Real estate: Manhattan townhouse (valued $77M, gifted by Wexner), Palm Beach estate, New Mexico ranch (Zorro), two private islands (Little St. James, Great St. James), Paris apartment
- Private Boeing 727 ("Lolita Express"), multiple other aircraft
- **The wealth vastly exceeds what documented clients explain**
- This gap has never been resolved and the new files don't close it

### The Leverage Model
NYT (Feb 6, 2026) titled their piece: "How Epstein Sought Leverage With the Wealthy." The model appears to be:
1. Cultivate wealthy/powerful targets
2. Provide access (girls, connections, financial services)
3. Document everything (cameras, photos, records)
4. Use documentation as leverage for ongoing financial relationships and protection
5. Intelligence agencies may have used the same material for their own leverage

This is a blackmail operation running as a financial advisory firm.

## The Four Named Co-Conspirators (NPA)

The exact language: "The United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, **including but not limited to** Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova."

### Sarah Kellen (now Sarah Kensington)
- Epstein's personal assistant and "second-in-command" after Maxwell
- Judge Nathan (Maxwell trial, 2022): "a knowing participant in the criminal conspiracy" and "a criminally responsible participant"
- Alleged to have scheduled underage girls for Epstein
- **Never charged**

### Nadia Marcinkova (now Nadia Marcinko)
- Slovakian-born. Epstein allegedly "purchased" her from her family when she was ~15
- Became a victim who was then groomed into being a perpetrator
- Later became a licensed pilot and flew Epstein's planes
- **Never charged**

### Adriana Ross (née Mucinska)
- Polish model
- Most silent of the four. Invoked Fifth Amendment in 2010 deposition
- Described as having been present during abuse
- **Never charged**

### Lesley Groff
- Epstein's executive assistant for decades
- When she became pregnant in 2004, Epstein bought her a Mercedes and paid for a full-time nanny. "There is no way that I could lose Lesley to motherhood"
- Managed schedules, logistics
- **Never charged**

### The Critical Phrase
"Including but not limited to" — this means the immunity extends to EVERYONE, not just these four. Ghislaine Maxwell was not named but was arguably covered. The clients who abused girls at Epstein's properties — arguably covered. Anyone in the network — covered.

This single phrase in a 2007 document immunized an unknown number of child sex traffickers. It was drafted by federal prosecutors and approved by a US Attorney who later said he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence."
