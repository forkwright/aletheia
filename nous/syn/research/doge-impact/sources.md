## Scale
- 300,000+ federal workers fired, laid off, or offered buyouts
- 9% federal civilian workforce reduction in 2025
- 50,000 career civil servants targeted for reclassification (removal of job protections)
- DOGE set to "conclude" July 4, 2026 (250th anniversary)

## Legal

- Multiple lawsuits challenging firings

## Current Structure
- Musk's direct DOGE role reduced
- Now operates through Russell Vought at OMB
- State-level DOGE entities emerging (Florida citing disputed DOE climate report)

## The Pattern
Gut institutional capacity → remove the people who know how things work → remove the people who would push back → consolidate control through OMB → claim efficiency while consequences unfold over years
