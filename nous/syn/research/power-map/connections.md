# Power Map — Cross-Domain Connections

## Epstein → Current Administration
- **Howard Lutnick**: Planned island visit 2012 → Now Secretary of Commerce
- **Alexander Acosta**: Shelved 32-count indictment, approved plea deal → Was Trump's Secretary of Labor (first term)
- **Elon Musk**: Cordial emails, planned island visits → Runs DOGE, gutted USAID, 9.4M projected deaths
- **Donald Trump**: Name redacted in multiple locations in files → President, directing ICE operations, threatened Insurrection Act
- **Todd Blanche**: DOJ #2, declined to investigate both ICE killings of US citizens → Also handling Epstein file redactions

## DOGE → Global Consequences
- DOGE gutted USAID → 450 health centers closed in Afghanistan → child hunger worst in 25 years
- DOGE gutted USAID → HIV clinics closed in South Africa
- DOGE gutted USAID → Food aid terminated to Afghanistan + Yemen → famine conditions
- DOGE firing federal workers → institutional knowledge destroyed → no one left to push back on ICE violations

## ICE → Rule of Law Breakdown
- 96 court orders violated in 5 weeks → no consequences
- Two US citizens killed → federal government blocking investigations
- 5th Circuit providing legal cover for mass detention
- Trump threatening Insurrection Act against protests → military deployment against domestic dissent

## Information Architecture
- Epstein files: perpetrators redacted, victims exposed
- ICE killings: official narrative contradicted by video, but video doesn't change outcome
- USAID: 9.4M projected deaths gets one news cycle
- Sudan: active genocide, zero sustained coverage
- Pattern: truth is available but structurally irrelevant

## The Thread
The same names appear across domains. The same protection patterns. The same upward flow of immunity and downward flow of consequences. This is not multiple crises. It is one system operating as designed.
