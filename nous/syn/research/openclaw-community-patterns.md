# OpenClaw Community Usage Patterns

*Research via Perplexity, 2026-01-28*

## High-Value Patterns

### Data Capture & Processing
- **Receipt → spreadsheet → file**: Photo of receipt → extract items → structure table → generate .xlsx → return in-chat
- **Directory monitoring**: Always-on file lifecycle management — trigger on file arrival, organize, rename, convert, report back

### Proactive Automation
- **Home automation**: Morning routines (weather, calendar), appliance control, context-aware triggers
- **Finance monitoring**: Crypto price alerts with conditions, auto-execute trades at thresholds
- **Health integration**: WHOOP sleep data analysis, meal planning, meditation prompts

### Creative & Media
- **Website building from phone**: User had Moltbot create and deploy full site via Telegram
- **Blog automation**: Generate drafts, optimize SEO, schedule publishing, analyze engagement
- **Video/Audio**: Video generation (Veo/Sora-style), voice synthesis, podcast transcription, show-notes

### Security-Conscious Remote Control
- Least-privilege shell access from phone
- Directory organization, batch jobs, disk usage inspection

## Ideas for Our Setup

Based on Cody's stack:

| Pattern | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Directory monitoring | dianoia inbox processing |
| File lifecycle | Organize downloads, rename media |
| Receipt capture | Expense tracking (if needed) |
| Health integration | If Cody uses wearables |
| Proactive briefs | Already doing morning-brief |
| Remote control | Already have SSH access |
