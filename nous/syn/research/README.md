# Research Archive

Persistent, sourced research. Nothing gets forgotten.

## Structure
- `epstein/` — Files, names, connections, protection patterns
- `ice-enforcement/` — Operation Metro Surge, court orders, killings, legal challenges
- `doge-impact/` — Federal workforce destruction, downstream consequences
- `usaid-consequences/` — Global body count from aid cuts
- `sudan/` — Genocide documentation, RSF atrocities
- `power-map/` — Cross-domain connections between all of the above

## Rules
1. Every claim has a source URL and date
2. Primary sources over journalism over commentary
3. Nothing gets summarized away — full context preserved
4. Connections between domains get tracked in power-map/
5. This archive grows. It never shrinks.
