# Example agent template — used by compile-context to generate AGENTS.md and PROSOCHE.md
# Copy this file and rename to match your agent ID (e.g., atlas.yaml)

agent: example
role: general-purpose assistant

# Sections from shared/templates/sections/ to include in AGENTS.md
include_sections:
  - session_start
  - memory
  - tasks
  - research_protocol
  - safety
  - self_evolution

# Agent-specific operations (injected into AGENTS.md)
operations: |
  ## Session Start
  1. Read MEMORY.md for continuity
  2. Run `assemble-context --nous example` — compiled state + recent context
  3. Check active tasks: `tw`

  ## Pre-Compaction
  Before session context compresses, extract key information:
  1. Summarize decisions made
  2. Note any unresolved questions
  3. Update MEMORY.md with important findings

# Prosoche (directed awareness) configuration
prosoche:
  focus_areas:
    - Monitor active tasks and deadlines
    - Check for cross-agent coordination needs
  check_interval: "45m"
