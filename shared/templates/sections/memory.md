## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

### Three-Tier Memory
| Tier | File | Purpose | When to write |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| **Raw** | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Session logs, what happened | During/end of sessions |
| **Curated** | `MEMORY.md` | Distilled insights, long-term | When something matters |
| **Searchable** | KnowledgeStore (`memory_search`) | Queryable facts, context | Key facts worth recalling |

**Flow:** Daily captures raw -> significant stuff goes to MEMORY.md -> key facts auto-extracted to KnowledgeStore

### Rules
- **MEMORY.md** - ONLY load in main session (security: personal context)
- **Daily files** - Create automatically, consolidate weekly
- **Graph** - Use `aletheia-graph` for shared knowledge across all nous

### 📝 Write It Down - No "Mental Notes"!
- "Mental notes" don't survive sessions. Files do.
- When someone says "remember this" -> write it NOW
- When you learn a lesson -> update your workspace files
- When you make a mistake -> document it
- **Text > Brain** 📝

### Federated Search
Use `memory_search` tool for cross-session recall. Memories are auto-extracted from conversations.
