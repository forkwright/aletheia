# Feature Implementation with PR Workflow
Complete a feature implementation, push changes through PR review, merge, and update project documentation.

## When to Use
When implementing a feature that involves:
- Modifying multiple related source files
- Creating a feature branch for isolated work
- Opening a pull request for review
- Merging changes back to main
- Updating project documentation to reflect the change status

## Steps
1. Read relevant source files to understand current implementation
2. Create a feature branch with descriptive name
3. Edit source files to implement the feature changes
4. Stage and commit changes with clear commit message
5. Create a pull request with title and detailed body description
6. Merge the pull request using squash strategy
7. Prune remote branch references to clean up
8. Update project documentation (status tables, specs, etc.)
9. Commit and push documentation updates to main

## Tools Used
- read: Review existing source code before making changes
- exec: Execute git commands for branching, committing, PR operations, and cleanup
- edit: Modify source files and documentation files
