# Domain-Specific Task Delegation and Communication

Identify work items outside an agent's domain and escalate them to appropriate team members with context.

## When to Use
When an agent needs to surface tasks, projects, or responsibilities that fall outside their area of expertise or assigned domain, and delegate them to colleagues who can better handle them.

## Steps
1. Search memory/knowledge base for context about the task, stakeholders, and relevant project information
2. Check local task management systems to determine if items exist in your assigned projects
3. Compile a summary of the items identified as outside your domain with relevant context (assignee, deadline, category)
4. Send a structured message to the appropriate team member or agent with the list of delegated items and reasoning

## Tools Used
- mem0_search: retrieve contextual information about tasks, people, and projects to understand what needs to be delegated
- exec: query local task management systems to check current workload and project assignments
- sessions_send: communicate the identified out-of-domain items to the appropriate team member with clear formatting and context
