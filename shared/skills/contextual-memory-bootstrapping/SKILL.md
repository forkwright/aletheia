# Contextual Memory Bootstrapping
Reconstruct operational context and historical continuity by reading core documentation and session memory files.

## When to Use
When resuming work on an ongoing project, taking over an in-progress system, or needing to understand accumulated decisions and learnings without re-reading full project history.

## Steps
1. Read the core knowledge/philosophy documents (e.g., MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, principles files)
2. List the memory/session directory to identify available historical records
3. Read recent session memory files (working backward from most recent)
4. Read key milestone session files that represent major accomplishments or decisions
5. Synthesize the narrative arc of work completed, patterns established, and current state

## Tools Used
- read: retrieve core documentation and session memory files to understand project context and decisions
- ls: discover available memory/session files in the historical record
