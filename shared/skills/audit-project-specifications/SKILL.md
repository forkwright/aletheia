# Audit Project Specifications
Systematically enumerate and review all specification documents in a project directory to understand scope, status, and priorities.

## When to Use
When you need to quickly assess the complete set of project specifications, understand what work is planned, check status of multiple initiatives, or get an overview of project scope before diving into specific tasks.

## Steps
1. List all specification files in the specs directory with headers to quickly identify them
2. Read each specification file in full to capture complete details
3. Aggregate findings to understand overall project structure, priorities, and interdependencies

## Tools Used
- exec: Used to run shell commands for directory traversal (listing files with headers) and reading specification documents
