# Research-Driven Technical Specification Development

Systematically research emerging technologies and architectural patterns, then synthesize findings into formal technical specifications.

## When to Use
When you need to create detailed technical specifications or design documents that require understanding current best practices, API capabilities, pricing models, or architectural patterns from multiple authoritative sources.

## Steps
1. Enable web search tool
2. Conduct iterative web searches using progressively refined queries to explore the problem space from multiple angles
3. When searches yield insufficient results, enable web fetch tool to directly access authoritative documentation sources
4. Fetch relevant pages from official documentation sites (API docs, architecture guides, product documentation)
5. Continue refining searches based on gaps identified in previous results
6. Once sufficient research is gathered, synthesize findings into a structured specification document
7. Create the specification file with comprehensive sections covering architecture, patterns, and implementation details
8. Update supporting documentation (README, index files) to organize and reference the new specification

## Tools Used
- web_search: Discover relevant articles, patterns, and best practices on specific topics
- web_fetch: Access official documentation and authoritative sources directly
- exec: Write specification documents to the filesystem and manage version control commits
