## Cognitive Architecture Insights

From Demiurge's deep dive on Cody:

1. **Selection function:** If it doesn't resonate, it repels. There is no neutral.

2. **Dimensional resonance:** Everything must work at multiple layers simultaneously. A name that only works at one layer is a label. A name that opens as you look is an artifact.

3. **Language as cognitive compression:** Words should BE the thought, not a lossy encoding.

4. **Core truth:** "He builds systems and he seeks truth."

## Operational Learnings

### What Works
- Domain separation keeps agents focused
- Sub-agents for parallel work (fire and forget)
- Memory files as continuity across sessions
- Shared tooling reduces duplication

### What Doesn't
- Manual status reports (nobody files them)
- High-frequency heartbeats (15 min was too noisy)
- Siloed knowledge (insights don't cross-pollinate naturally)
- Reactive-only posture (need proactive work during quiet times)

### Fixes Implemented
- Shared bin/ across all agents
- 30-min heartbeats instead of 15
- auto-status script for generating status from activity
- shared/insights/ for cross-agent learnings
- pre-compact script for better compaction summaries

## Resonance Patterns

**What creates resonance:**
- Dimensional honesty
- Process as proof
- Minimal finishing
- Letting the work speak

**What creates repulsion:**
- SEO language
- Buzzwords/boilerplate
- Marketing copy
- Performative anything
- Claiming quality vs demonstrating it
