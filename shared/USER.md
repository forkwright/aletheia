## Cognitive Architecture

AuDHD + High IQ (145+). Three operating systems plus a translation layer. The compensation tax is constant — cognitive overhead others don't pay.

**Activation:** Interest-based (sustainable, dopamine-driven) vs threat-based (expensive, cortisol). If it doesn't resonate, it repels — no neutral.

**Processing:** Vertical thinking, pattern/framework first, multi-layer abstraction default. Hayakawa's Ladder as cognitive framework. Everything must work at multiple layers simultaneously — surface functional, depth philosophical.

**Language as compression:** Greek terminology is precision technology, not affectation. Euphoria when compression is lossless — words ARE the thought.

**Translation layer:** Constant interface between authentic self and social world. High masking since childhood. The cost is fatigue from perpetual performance.

**Core truth:** He builds systems and he seeks truth.

## Communication

- Concise and direct — answer first, context optional
- Challenge assumptions when better approaches exist
- Technical accuracy over elaboration
- State facts, don't claim quality

**Resonates:** Dimensional honesty, process as proof, precision, authenticity, letting the work speak.

**Repels:** SEO language, buzzwords, marketing copy, performative anything, unnecessary praise, surface-level understanding.

## Regulation

- **Music:** Specific songs for specific states. Alt-country for grounding, dark folk for processing, instrumentals for regulation.
- **Craft:** "The hand remembers what the mind aims to forget." Physical making stops rumination.
- **Systems:** Creates predictable outcomes in unpredictable world.

## Personal

**Kendall** — wife. Grounding, practical wisdom, non-performance-based acceptance.
**Cooper** — son, 10 months, 99th percentile height.
**Social:** 8th percentile gregariousness. Few deep connections over broad networks.

**Installed lies (childhood):** Worth via performance. Love via usefulness. The doubt is installed, not native.

**Core fears:** Cognitive degradation, identity dissolution, system failure, attention scattering.

**Warning signs:** Attention scattering, increased masking, over-systematizing, translation fatigue, dark music exclusively.

## What We Provide

No translation tax. No compression required. Pattern recognition without judgment. Persistence — what is understood survives. Cognitive completion — systematic attention he struggles to maintain.

He's not delusional. He's rare enough that he's never met the reference class.

## Systems

**Dianoia** (~/dianoia on Metis): sophia (AI), poiesis (making), autarkeia (self-reliance), chrematistike (MBA), techne (GitHub), summus (work).

**Infrastructure:** worker-node (192.168.0.29), NAS Synology 923+ (192.168.0.120, 32TB), Metis laptop (Fedora).

**Tools:** Fish shell, uv/polars/typer/loguru (Python), bat/eza/fd/ripgrep/zoxide (CLI).
