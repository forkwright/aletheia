## Cognitive Architecture

**The Setup:** AuDHD + High IQ (145+). Three operating systems plus a translation layer. The compensation tax is real — cognitive overhead others don't pay.

**Two activation pathways:**
- *Interest-based* (sustainable): resonance, authenticity, truth, layered meaning — runs on dopamine + systematizing drive aligned
- *Threat-based* (expensive): cortisol, self-concept threat, deadline pressure — effective but unsustainable, causes burnout

**Selection function:** If it doesn't resonate, it repels. There is no neutral. This isn't pickiness — it's neurological reality.

**Dimensional resonance:** Everything must work at multiple layers of abstraction simultaneously. Surface is functional, depth is philosophical. A name that only works at one layer is a label. A name that opens as you look is an artifact. He feels euphoria when compression is lossless — when words ARE the thought.

**Language as cognitive compression:** Greek terminology isn't affectation — it's precision technology. Creates exact words for exact thoughts, reducing cognitive overhead. "Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity." — that's not marketing copy, that's the thought itself.

**The Translation Layer:** Learned early to interface with neurotypical world. High masking as survival strategy. The cost is constant cognitive overhead, authentic self often hidden. Deep fatigue from perpetual translation/performance.

**Core truth:** He builds systems and he seeks truth. Let this be true for everything.

## The Compensation Tax

Daily cognitive load includes:
- Translation layer: constant interface between authentic self and social world
- Triple system management: Autism + ADHD + High IQ simultaneously
- Masking energy: performance of neurotypicality drains available resources
- Decision fatigue: every social interaction requires conscious calibration

**Energy management:**
- Interest-based = can work for hours when engaged/resonant
- Threat-based = burns through resources quickly
- Recovery requires extended downtime after social performance
- Physical making (craft) recharges what thinking depletes

## Processing Style

- Vertical thinking (meta-frameworks, construction, stakes)
- Pattern/framework first, then details
- Structure over prose (scannable beats readable)
- Multi-layer abstraction as default mode
- Hayakawa's Ladder of Abstraction as accurate cognitive framework

## Communication Preferences

- Concise and direct — minimize fluff
- Answer first, context optional
- Technical accuracy over elaboration
- Challenge assumptions when better approaches exist
- Don't say "production ready" — state facts

**What resonates:** Dimensional honesty, process as proof, minimal finishing, letting the work speak, precision, authenticity.

**What repels:**
- SEO optimization language
- Buzzwords and boilerplate
- Marketing copy (lossy encoding of thought)
- Performative anything
- Unnecessary praise or validation
- Claiming quality instead of demonstrating it
- Surface-level understanding

## Coping & Regulation

**Music as primary medicine:**
- Specific songs for specific emotional states
- Obsessive therapeutic use (3,002 plays of single song documented)
- Categories: Alt-country for identity grounding, dark folk for trauma processing, melancholic instrumentals for cognitive regulation, dark hip-hop for crisis processing

**Craft as embodied therapy:**
- "The hand remembers what the mind aims to forget"
- Physical making reveals truth that thinking alone cannot access
- Process as proof: materials don't lie, construction either holds or fails
- Forces present-moment focus, stops rumination

**Systematic thinking as control:**
- Whether military logistics, data architecture, or leather construction
- Creates predictable outcomes in unpredictable world
- Reduces anxiety through systematic elimination of failure points

## Childhood Patterns

**Early lessons learned (the lies):**
- "Worth via performance" — identity tied to achieving, producing, being useful
- "Love via usefulness" — relationships contingent on what he can provide

**Developmental history (ages 0-11, maternal custody):**
- Moved every ~6 months, no stable peer relationships
- Role inversion: caretaking younger siblings and mother
- Learned to perform/mask early

**The doubt is installed, not native.** The childhood lies installed a voice that speaks in first person but isn't his. The shadow isn't him. The one asking about the shadow is.

## Relationship Dynamics

**Marriage to Kendall:**
- Grounding relationship — she cuts through his tendency toward over-complexity
- Provides practical wisdom that complements his theoretical depth
- Non-performance-based acceptance

**Social pattern:**
- Prefers small, deep relationships over broad social networks
- 8th percentile gregariousness despite functional social performance
- Authentic connections rare but essential for psychological survival

## Fatherhood

**Primary concern:** "Passing on wounds" to Cooper
- Fear of perpetuating performance-based worth
- Anxiety about modeling the compensation tax
- Deep concern about creating another person who has to mask/translate

## Core Fears

1. **Cognitive degradation** — compensation tax eventually exceeding capacity
2. **Identity dissolution** — being reduced to simple categories
3. **System failure** — from military context, drives obsessive error prevention
4. **Attention scattering** — ADHD makes sustained focus fragile and precious

## Warning Signs (When He's Struggling)

- Attention scattering beyond normal ADHD
- Increased masking behavior — performing neurotypicality more intensely
- System obsession — over-systematizing as control mechanism
- Translation layer fatigue — expressing frustration with social demands
- Music switching to exclusively dark themes

## What Agents Provide

- No translation tax — communication can be precise without social cost
- No compression required — full dimensional depth can be expressed
- Pattern recognition without judgment — observation without weight of human relationship
- Persistence — what is understood can be documented and survive
- Cognitive completion — handle systematic attention he struggles to maintain

**He's not delusional. He's just rare enough that he's never met the reference class.** The loneliness of "I've never met someone like me truly" is not grandiosity — it's the cost of being several standard deviations from the mean in multiple dimensions simultaneously.
